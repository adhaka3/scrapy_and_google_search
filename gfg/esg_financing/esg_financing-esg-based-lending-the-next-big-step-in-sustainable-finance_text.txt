ESG-based lending: The next big step in sustainable financeSustainable-based lending is soon becoming the go-to option for lenders, to adopt ESG practices. ETBFSI gives you a quick overview on this topic. ETBFSI December 23, 2021, 08:00 IST
- BY ANUSHKA SENGUPTASustainable finance has been the talk of the town recently, and to encourage this, financial institutions are beginning to resort to Environmental, social, and governance-based lending. Along with financial institutions, regulators, for instance the Securities and Exchange Board of India, is also examining disclosures of ESG aspects by credit agencies.Another common way to opt for sustainable finance is by investing in segments such as energy generation, which include solar photovoltaics, on and offshore wind, hydropower and broader energy services.According to Dinesh Khara, chairman of State Bank of India, India's green finance definition could be formed through a combination of adopting international practices, developing a set of principles for green economic activities and obtaining stakeholders' views.What are ESG-linked loans?ESG linked loans incentivises companies' commitment to sustainability by linking the financial terms of a loan to predetermined sustainability performance targets (SPTs) that are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs). However, in some cases, SPTs are also determined on the basis of companies donating to environmental charities or to other ESG projects. S&P BSE Greenex; S&P BSE 100 ESG and S&P BSE Carbonex are the three sustainability investing indices on BSE.Are ESG linked loans the same as green loans?Green loans are quite different from ESG loans, as the former can only be utilised to finance green projects, while for the latter, the use of loan proceeds is not a determinant. However, ESG linked loans can be green loans, as it can fund green projects.Why are companies increasingly opting for ESG strategies?ESG analysis can help lenders or investors identify sustainability of a business in the long run. It will help assess how companies are dealing and interacting with their stakeholders as a part of their business processes. A strong ESG proposition correlates with higher equity returns, from both a tilt and momentum perspective, according to a report by McKinsey. Better performance in ESG also corresponds with a reduction in downside risk, due to lower loan and credit default swap spreads and higher credit ratings, the report addedWhy is India opting for ESG practice?In 2015, India signed up for the Paris Climate Protection Agreement, 2015, where it committed to drive economic growth in a climate-friendly manner and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed for a more sustainable environment. The three sustainability indices of India outperformed the Sensex during the pandemic, indicating the rise of interest in sustainable finance, and thereby encouraging companies to opt for socially responsible investments.How is India planning to devise its sustainable finance plan?State Bank of India said that it is devising its strategy to give out loans based on ESG ratings. The bank is planning to hike renewable energy sector loans from Rs 33,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore, incentivise companies with good ESG scores, and push for green products and projects like green car loans.A new Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening of the Financial System (NGFS) has emerged, and the Reserve Bank of India is also heading towards forming a Sustainable Finance Group (SFG) that would lay down the rules and regulations of ESG based lending. SEBI chief Ajay Tyagi said that the regulator is in the process of bringing out disclosure for mutual fund schemes with the ESG theme.
