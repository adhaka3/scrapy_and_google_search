Sustainable bond issuance in 2021 and 2022 - value ($bn)
The graph breaks down monthly issuance for the years 2021 and 2022. December month was left out
intentionally as issuances are still ongoing at the time of reporting. Total issuance for 2021 stood at $1
trillion while the same figure for 2022 is $807 billion.
2022 started off with a strong start with issuance nearly reaching $100 billion in January. However, from
February issuance dropped significantly up until May 2022. Most likely, due to the war in Ukraine.
Issuance picked up in May and nearly equalled 2021’s $95 billion. Volatility and exceptionally high
inflation which triggered aggressive interest rate rises all around the globe appear to have had a
significant impact on 2022 sustainable bond issuance.
