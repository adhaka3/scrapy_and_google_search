Building a more sustainable
tomorrow by investing well
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria is used to benchmark the ethical conduct of companies and countries, and their ability to positively impact the environment and community that we live in, for a more sustainable and socially responsible future.
We reap what we sow. And the decisions we make today will shape the future. Join us in building a better tomorrow by investing sustainably!
Business decisions were at one time driven almost exclusively by profit. But this is slowly changing with the growing recognition that there are other considerations that must be taken into account, such as people and the planet. The impact of our decisions on the world, society, environment and ecosystems at large has become an increasingly important item on the business agenda. With this, sustainability, through its three sub-areas – Environmental, Social, Governance or ESG – has gained its rightful place in today’s narrative.
Key areas of ESG include:
Environmental
Natural world and resources conservation
Climate change and carbon emission
Air and water pollution
Energy efficiency
Water management
Water scarcity
Biodiversity and deforestation
Social
People and relationships
Gender and diversity policies
Human rights
Labour standards
Employee engagement
Customer satisfaction
Community relations
Governance
Stewardship
Board composition
Executive compensation
Audit committee structure
Bribery and corruption policies
Lobbying activities
Political contributions
With sustainability at the core and by weaving ESG practices into the decisions we make on people, processes and products, we hope to contribute even more to creating long-term value and a better tomorrow.

Insights
Why ESG Investing?
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) are the three pillars that investors use to evaluate how sustainable a business and its performance are. Not surprisingly, ESG investing has attracted investors’ attention like never before. This has given rise to significant growth in what is known as responsible investing.
You have everything to gain when you shift from a profit focus to a more holistic approach that incorporates socio-environmental value and responsible investing. This enables you to make ESG-integrated decisions for value creation and impact investing.
How is this so? Contrary to popular belief, one need not compromise on returns when investing in ESG-integrated investments as they too take into account profits and risks, whilst seeking to ensure the sustainability factor is properly built into the equation. ESG consciousness motivates individuals and businesses to pursue the best corporate and management practices alongside ensuring the social wellbeing of the community and conservation and preservation of the environment. Combined, these can translate into favourable financial performance in the long run based on the real strength of the investment. The beauty of ESG-integrated investments is that you can enjoy both resilience and returns without having to choose between the two.
So, if you are seeking strong financial returns while doing good, start your sustainable investing journey with us today! Do well by doing good.
