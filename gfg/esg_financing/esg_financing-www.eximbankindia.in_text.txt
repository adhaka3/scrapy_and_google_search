EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF INDIA
ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) FRAMEWORK (Ver. December 2021)
Introduction
Established by the Government of India (“GoI”) in 1982, Export-Import Bank of India (“EXIM Bank” or the “Bank”) is the premier export finance institution of India, with a mission to facilitate the globalisation of Indian businesses.The Bank seeks to provide financial assistance to exporters and importers through acting as the principal financial institution for coordinating the working of institutions engaged in financing export and import of goods and services, with a view to promote India’s international trade.
Over the years, EXIM Bank’s vision has evolved from a product-centric approach with Export Credits and Export Capability Creation to a more customer-centric approach by offering a comprehensive range of products and services to empower business at all stages of a company’s business cycle. The Bank develops commercially viable relationships with a target set of externally oriented companies through a wide array of products and services, aimed at enhancing their internationalisation efforts. Going forward, EXIM Bank aspires to capitalise on its leadership and expertise in Export Finance to enhance Indian companies with global aspirations.
EXIM Bank’s Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Approach
EXIM Bank has in place a board-approved ESG Policy for Sustainable Development / Responsible Financing. The ESG Policy seeks to ensure compliance with the respective host country regulations and envisages evolution of a common policy approach for all lenders in the consortium.
EXIM Bank is also involved in the deliberations led by the Indian Banks Association (“IBA”) on a sustainability framework for banks. The IBA has appreciated the efforts of the Bank, among others, for making progress on integrating ESG-based risk assessment into the credit appraisal process, as well as on aspects of green investment using new modes of green finance.
Externally, EXIM Bank has been promoting sustainable banking both in India as well as internationally through its various financing programmes. The Bank has been funding projects in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, mass transportation and energy efficient transport. Notably, Exim Bank was awarded for its best practices in the Category of Sustainable Financing Programme in the Latin American Association of Development Financing Institutions (ALIDE) Awards for 2019, held at the 49th General Assembly of ALIDE in Madrid, Spain.
Internally, EXIM Bank has been reviewing its operations for ESG-related parameters. The Bank has taken up electrical audit and associated measures for optimising energy consumption. Notable initiatives include the installations of solar panels at the Bank’s staff quarters, LED lights in the work areas and motion sensor lights at its Head Office, which has considerably reduced energy consumption. Other initiatives include minimizing the use of paper through digitization of workflows, organizing sapling plantation drives, replacement of paper cups and single-use plastic water bottles with reusable glass mugs and bottles in the Bank’s facilities, and participation in beach clean-up drives. Exim Bank was also awarded with the Indian Green Building Council’s (IGBC) Green Interiors Platinum rating for its New Delhi office.
In terms of social responsibility, EXIM Bank has also been at the forefront in supporting causes including women empowerment and upliftment of underprivileged children. The Bank also promotes inclusive growth through its grassroot initiatives and development group.
EXIM Bank’s Lines of Credit Facility
Exim Bank, on behalf and with the support of GoI, extends Lines of Credit (“LOCs”) to sovereign governments, regional development banks and overseas entities to promote development in partner countries and support export of projects, goods and services from India. The Bank has extended LOCs to various overseas Governments, which includes countries in the Africa, Asia, LAC, CIS and Oceania regions.
These LOCs finance projects such as food securityand irrigation development,social infrastructure and development projects, construction of hospitals and setting up of water supply schemes, farm mechanisation, establishment of rural broadband networks, solar power projects.
Apart from the above-mentioned LOC facilities, Exim Bank also extends financing to overseas buyers to support exports of goods, projects and services from India, including engineering works, turnkey projects, technical and consultancy services and supplies. The facility is also available for the development, upgrading and expansion of infrastructure facilities including green projects and socially sustainable projects.
