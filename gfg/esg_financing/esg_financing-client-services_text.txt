Why Treasury?The Treasury is uniquely positioned to provide customized technical assistance/advisory services for the issuance of such bonds and the development of sustainable bond markets. The Bank issued the world’s first green bond in 2008, defining a specific process that provides investors with full assurance that these projects will address climate change. Since 2008, the World Bank issued approximately USD 18 billion equivalent in Green Bonds through over 200 bonds in 25 currencies (as of 12/13/2021). Both sovereigns and private companies have since joined this market as issuers.  In 2018, Treasury helped found the Blue Bond market. Working closely with Seychelles, it helped structure and de-risk the transaction so the government could issue the fixed-income market’s first debt instrument supporting ocean-based sustainability projects. All World Bank bonds are sustainable development bonds that support the financing of a combination of green and social, i.e. “sustainable development”, projects, programs, and activities in IBRD member countries. The World Bank issues approximately USD 40-50 billion each year to fund its sustainable development activities in agriculture, education, energy, finance/trade/industry, governance, health and social services, transportation, water/sanitation and themes: gender, environment.
Thematic bonds such as green, blue and social bonds (i) raise money for investments that delivers sustainable economic and social outcomes and (ii) offer investors the opportunity to earn competitive financial returns and diversify their portfolios while supporting positive societal impact. These bonds are bought by a growing number of investors who have begun to embed Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards into their investment decisions. The World Bank (Bank) has played a leading role in founding and developing these markets.What are green and blue bonds?Green and blue bonds raise financing for development with clear environmental benefits on land and at sea, e.g. power generation from renewables, infrastructure that increases energy efficiency, and sustainable fishing economies.What are social bonds?Social bonds finance projects that benefit under-served populations with limited access to essential services such as basic infrastructure or finance. What are the challenges?There has been slower growth in green bond markets in emerging countries than developed ones, largely due to less developed capital markets and lack of market awareness and knowledge of the green bond issuance process.Treasury Advisory ServicesThe World Bank Financial Advisory and Banking team facilitates the development of green, blue and social bond markets in emerging markets through pre- and post-issuance technical assistance for issuers. Why Treasury?The Treasury is uniquely positioned to provide customized technical assistance/advisory services for the issuance of such bonds and the development of sustainable bond markets.
