Companies can leverage their ESG performance to improve their bottom line and their company’s overall ESG performance through Sustainability Linked Loans (SLLs). SLLs give borrowers the opportunity to apply the loan toward general business purposes
as the terms are tied solely to the borrowers ESG-related performance and not the use of proceeds or the projects financed. This flexibility has made the SLL a popular alternative to traditional capital raising and debt. Learn more about our SLL service.
