ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance Factors
The management of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors is critical to the ability of any organization to generate long-term value.
‘Environmental
factors consider how an organization performs as a steward of nature’. The ‘E’ refers to the performance of a government, a financial institution, or a company with respect to climate change, use of biodiversity and natural resources, management of waste, among other factors or issues to be taken into account.
Social factors refer to the relationship of the organization with its different stakeholders; whether employees, customers or suppliers, communities, citizens, etc. The ‘S’ factors involve human rights, labor rights and working conditions, occupational health and safety, equal opportunities, indigenous people rights, and more broadly human rights.
Governance factors refer, among others, to the allocation of roles, responsibilities and rights between the different stakeholders in the governance of a financial institution or a company, or in the political governance structures of a country. The ‘G’ factors involve issues such as transparency and reporting.

For the financial sector, the integration of ESG factors into capital allocation decision-making should be at the core of sustainable finance.
Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS)
Each organization faces different ESG risks -or opportunities- which are dependent on, among other notions, its specific sector and context of operations. For a financial institution, for instance, ESG risks derive mainly from its lending or investing activities and are inherent to its clients’ and/or investees’ business activities. Hence, each organization should develop an ESG risks management system bespoke to its ESG risk profile, integrated into its business model, and grounded on policies and internal control systems.
ESG performance assessments
The evaluation and rating of organizations based on their relative ESG performance and readiness is playing a growing role in risk management, investment strategies, and the development of new sustainable finance products. To this end, investors and financiers are building in-house analytical capabilities, directly engaging with clients and investees, and/or relying on third-party providers of ESG data and ESG performance assessment (ESG rating, ESG scoring).
The “ESG ratings” are now increasingly being used as a way to structure sustainable debt products – such as the so-called sustainability linked bonds.

Why ESG?
The integration of Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") factors continues to expand globally. According to Reuters, “a record $650 billion was poured into ESG-focused funds worldwide. ESG funds account for 10% of fund assets globally". Thus asset managers continue to prioritize the integration of material ESG factors into existing investment solutions, while the development of new sustainable investment solutions continues to accelerate in response to the ever-growing investor interest.
Environment is, of course, only one aspect of the equation. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis emphasizes the importance of social and governance factors, as companies with a long-term focus have proven to be more resilient to date.
Organizations managing ESG risks are showing a stronger financial and operational performance and a better capacity to attract capital. Sustainable funds have shown to consistently outperform non-ESG funds in different time periods, over one, three, five and ten years. Initial evidence indicates that they also attracted greater interest among market participants and demonstrated heightened resilience when stock markets began to fail due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Regulators, investors, and financiers are steadily demanding transparency on organizations’ ESG risks profile and management capabilities. Regulators are increasingly recognizing ESG-related risks, and climate-related risks, in particular, as a source of potential material impact on firms’ performance and, more broadly on the stability of the entire financial system. As such, the number of regulatory-related initiatives calling for ESG risk management and disclosure is growing. Examples include the EU’s regulation on sustainability-related disclosures and Non-Financial Reporting Directive, the Statement on disclosure of ESG matters by issuers of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), or Brazil’s Resolution CMN 4.661/2018. Investors’ interest in and demand for ESG information is also growing.
Beyond regulatory compliance, investors realize the value of integrating ESG factors into their investment and voting decisions in order to mitigate risks and detect new business opportunities. This is evidenced by the growing development of ESG guidance and reporting requirements for thematic bond issuers and listed companies respectively. It is also documented by the increasing number of ESG-related shareholders proposals.
Success Cases
Eletrobras: A green bond issuance as the opportunity to work on an ESG rating
The objective was to support Eletrobras in getting an ESG Rating from Vigeo Eiris.The results were striking: Eletrobras scored 67/100, while the former score was 30/100, which led the company to become #1 among utilities in the world and Top 39 from a universe of almost 5,000 companies covered.
FIRA
FIRA started a long journey that ended up making it one of the sustainability champs among financial institutions in Mexico. FIRA had also started issuing debt in its domestic market, but the issuance of its first green bond represented a turning point in the process of fully integrating ESG factors into its business model.
