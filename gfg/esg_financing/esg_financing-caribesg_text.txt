How is ESG re-shaping business and investment in the Caribbean?

The 2nd annual Caribbean ESG & Climate Financing Summit arrives in Trinidad & Tobago, in-person for the first time, this November 29-30.
Launched in 2021, the inaugural event gathered 300 corporate, government and finance leaders, in what was a clear indication of the significance of ESG and climate finance to the competitiveness of the Caribbean.
For Caribbean corporates, ESG is no longer optional; it’s urgent: access to capital and trading partners will depend upon it. For Caribbean governments facing down extraordinary threats from climate change, access to climate-linked capital is critical. But in some quarters, the case still needs to be made.
The only forum in the region that gathers corporates, sovereigns, lenders and investors, the 2022 Caribbean ESG & Climate Financing Summit represents an opportunity to make a leap forward and to mainstream a new way of operating, and a new financing ecosystem, for the region.
The transformation is underway. Now we need to implement and accelerate. Be there for the region’s only ESG and climate financing event, as we make what happens next.
