AcceleratingAccelerating Global Sustainable Finance and Climate TransitionOceanWEP signatoryClimate Neutral NowESG Today InterviewWhy Sustainable Finance & ESG?Sustainable finance and ESG are increasingly taking hold of the global financial services sector. With sustainable finance issuances reaching new milestones in both developed and emerging markets, changing investment patterns are altering global financial markets. Around the world, financial institutions are catalysing private finance and advancing investments towards decarbonisation, positive social impact and improved governance. But this isn’t enough.For the global economy to be undergirded by sustainable finance and ESG, multi-stakeholder approaches to complex global challenges, is crucial. Policymakers, regulators, investors, financial institutions, businesses and multilateral organisations must collaboratively constitute an environmentally and economically sustainable global economy.As countries emerge out of the pandemic, greater demand on investments to meet long-term net zero and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) need to be supported by a holistic risk-return-impact appetite.
