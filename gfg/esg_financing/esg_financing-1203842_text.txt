Introduction
Environmental, social, governance (ESG) is the
focal point of all regulatory and policymaking agendas across the
world. The financial service sector is no recluse, and there are
pivots for changing this landscape for the better too.
Environmental criteria refers to the energy consumption of
the company, the resources it consumes, the waste it discharges and
the impact it has on the lives of living beings. The social
criteria addresses the relationships that the company has
(builds and aims to build) with the communities where it does
business in; labor relations, social diversity and inclusion, all
form part of this. Governance as a criterion focuses on
the internal systems, practices, processes, and compliance with the
law1.
In this article, we will discuss the prominent sectors and
regulators who have considerable inputs with respect to ESG in the
finance ecosystem. As a matter of fact, the cryptocurrency industry
which is infamous for its opacity and lack of acceptance, is also
fraught with ESG concerns, which we will explore right off the
bat.
Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and more than Crypto
There are apparent challenges in the form of sustainability of
cryptocurrencies, for there is a phenomenal rise in demand for
energy. Unilateral rhetoric of crypto-mining leading to undoing of
all environment sustainability efforts, or that of it being the
sustainable and green-er industry, has led to vested interests
coming to the fore. Depending on the message the regulator wants to
send out, we have seen governments swaying from being passive about
it, to either banning it, or regularizing it.
An industry which is not averse to creating shockwaves, across
the business world, ESG concerns, and sustainability have been on
the forefront of many discussions. The differing opinions in this
domain come from proof of work (PoW) and proof of
stake (PoS) mechanisms, with PoW being treated as
the sub-par technology with higher energy consumption. To the
dismay of most, as per the Bitcoin Mining Network Report published
by CoinShares in 2019, almost 73% of the energy utilized towards
mining activities stem from renewable energy sources1.
Without disregard to any mechanism of cryptocurrency, the ecosystem
will examine the better efficient assets, which would suit for
large-scale adoption.
In fact, there have been studies across cases and geographies,
of strengthened ESG helping reduce companies' risk of any
adverse government actions. One might even go on to say that it
engenders government support2. This could be one of the
key areas of focus for the cryptocurrency segment, which yearns for
legitimacy and faster adoption. Goes without saying that for
countries to meet their SDGs3, regulatory actions may
impose higher costs for carbon-intense industries; this might be an
opportune moment for this sector to revamp their operations and
embrace energy-efficient operations.
It is important for us to consider that ESG is beyond just
"E", and this is where this sector has felt the most
criticism; there is very little impetus put on the social inclusion
and digital aspects of this industry. However, with digital
transformation, decentralized finance, individuals now have easier
access to financing, almost no banking fees, better rates on
savings, and financial inclusion is being better afforded in this
manner. Distributed ledger technology, including blockchain, has
the potential and has been utilized to deliver, realize SDGs, on an
unparalleled scale. Governance will continue to be adaptive with
more awareness, better representation, and willingness to assume
risks and strategies for ESG. Fortunately, for this nascent
industry, which has so many use cases, the teams which are at the
forefront, all appear to be skilled strategy makers, and are highly
adaptive with respect to the requirements that may be sought at a
regulatory level, social level or at the level of consumer
awareness.
Asset and Fund Managers
Moving away from the much recent world of cryptocurrencies, the
sturdy and conventional set-up of asset and fund managers, and
asset owners are also being required by regulators and investors,
alike, to embed sustainable
investment4 across their business
activities and to adapt to all facets of ESG.
European Union
One of the interesting approaches undertaken was by the European
Union. The focus is four-pronged: (1) Taxonomy – focusing on
a unified classification on what can be considered
environmentally sustainable economic activities; (2)
Disclosure – focusing on obligations on the institutional
investors and asset managers to disclose how they integrate ESG
factors in their risk processes; (3) Benchmarks – creation of
categories of benchmarks, comprising low-carbon and positive carbon
impact benchmarks; and, (4) Sustainability Preferences –
requirement to include ESG considerations into the advice that
investment firms and insurance distributors offer to their
clients5.
The European Commission's delegated acts6,
allowed for the taxonomy regulation7 (EU
Taxonomy) to apply from January 01, 2022. These
regulations and the delegated acts are designed to help the
investors in making informed decisions on economic activities which
are economically sustainable; but do not disallow investments in
activities which are ineligible under this EU Taxonomy. This is the
first jurisdiction which has such taxonomical prescriptions in
place. The Members of the European Parliament have sought a
legislative proposal to include in the EU Taxonomy for sustainable
activities any crypto-asset mining activities that contribute
substantially to climate change, by 1 January 20258.
United States of America
President Biden's Executive Order9 on the
responsible development of digital assets also requests reports
from various US federal agencies which should address the effect of
consensus mechanisms on energy usage. This order requested the
various federal agencies exploring the short, medium, and long-term
effects of new digital asset technologies, such as proof-of-stake
cryptocurrency mining, on climate change and the energy sector.
With investors becoming more aware, they have expressed a need
for more consistent, comparable and reliable information about how
a registrant has addressed climate-related risks when conducting
its operations and developing its business strategy and financial
plan. Per the Securities Exchange Commission's
(SEC) proposed rules10, outside the
audited financial statements, (1) narrative disclosures about
climate-related risks, their impact and how the company manages
them; and (2) quantitative disclosures about greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions will now have to be made. Additionally, within the
audited financial statements, there are disclosure requirements
towards aggregate amount of climate-related costs both expensed and
capitalized.
India
India, with its exceptional technological advancement in the
finance space, and with being the cradle of several institutional
investors and funds, now also has its regulator suggesting
regulations for ESG ratings. As companies are being forced to
integrate ESG with their business practices, the Securities
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is also aligning
itself with the global practices. The SEBI released a consultation
paper11 on January 24, 2022, focusing on evaluation and
rating of ESG related parameters by ESG rating providers. The paper
goes on to say, "since the activities of ESG ratings
providers (ERPs) are typically not subject to regulatory oversight
at present, increasing reliance on such unregulated ESG rating
providers in securities markets raises concerns about the potential
risks it poses to investor protection, the transparency and
efficiency of markets, risk pricing, and capital allocation, among
others."
This seems a step in the right direction and will bring a
certain level of transparency and uniformity to the ecosystem. It
has been reported that a total of 11 mutual fund schemes, with INR
13,000 crore rupees ($1.72 billion) under their management in
India, have ESG as their theme12, which stresses on the
need to regulate ESG rating process. The proposal is to have SEBI
accredit these ERPs and has also suggested that every ERP should
have at least one specialist in data analytics, sustainability,
finance, information technology, and law. Factoring concerns
related to interested parties, the proposed paper also seeks ERPs
to formulate clear policies and make disclosures on their websites,
to avoid conflict of interest. An ERP should not provide ESG
ratings to its related entities or securities issued by them or the
ERP.
Subsequently, SEBI has constituted an advisory
committee13 on Environmental, Social and Governance
(ESG) matters, whose terms of reference include enhancements in
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report14, ESG
ratings and ESG investing.
Conclusion
We have witnessed that when it comes to ESG concerns,
environment does find a lot of prominence, mostly following all the
international commitments, signing of climate-change accords, and
net-zero emission targets. However, with companies realizing that
to bring in a competitive advantage they need sustainability, ESG
issues are up higher, if not right on top, of board agendas. The
need for social investing has never been greater, in the face of
Covid-19 pandemic, the disparity in gender roles when it comes to
workplaces became a lot apparent. The institutional investors have
the scale, the wherewithal that is required for making a change in
social inclusion, a reality.
It is not incorrect to say that the investors demands actually
motivate the behavior of the institutions. While there is
skepticism in regulatory push, the demands of the investors are
being felt on the capital markets, which in turns drives the need
for ESG to be integrated into business practice. The time to blend
ESG into practice is now, and the world of finance is capable of
driving the change.
