<p>Regulatory requirements (particularly those being proposed by the European Union) and pressure from equity investors have made the funding of socially positive investments a key strategic imperative for bank lenders going forward. Non-bank lenders are also motivated by a shift in institutional investors&rsquo; thinking on ESG issues from avoiding a prescribed set of harmful industries, such as fossil fuels, to actively seeking out a broader range of borrowers that are contributing to a sustainable, progressive or green economy. Borrowers can take advantage of this increased demand to reach additional sources of debt capital, lower their borrowing costs and enhance their broader corporate and public reputation.</p>
<h3 style="color: #002b51;">The evolution of green loans</h3>
<p>The loan market&rsquo;s first ESG product was the &ldquo;green loan&rdquo;, a loan in which the permitted use of proceeds is limited to funding environmentally positive projects or initiatives (read &ldquo;<a href="/our-latest-thinking/publications/2021/03/green-bonds-and-beyond-sustainable-finance-in-the-capital-markets">Green bonds and beyond: sustainable finance in the capital markets</a>&rdquo; for a broad survey of sustainable financing trends). An example is the loan to finance the construction of the Tapestry at Victoria Harbour, an energy efficient residential development in British Columbia. While the scope of acceptable green projects is broad, including corporate initiatives to increase energy efficiency or reduce waste as well as more prototypical renewable energy project financings, the focus of green loans is limited to environmental sustainability issues, a subset of the broader ESG universe.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, much of the loan market&rsquo;s ESG focus has shifted to sustainability linked loans (SLL). SLLs are loans for general corporate purposes so proceeds are not limited to funding green projects or initiatives. Instead, the loans periodically track specified sustainability-based key performance indicators (KPIs) and measure them against pre-negotiated targets and reward (or punish) borrowers for their progress with interest rate adjustments. This approach fits into the basic architecture for interest rate step-downs and step-ups that track financial-based adjustments (such as those based on leverage) that have long been prevalent in the loan market. Supplementing financial metrics with ESG-based KPIs in setting margins (a proxy for the lenders&rsquo; perceived risk of repayment) demonstrates that lenders are placing a value on borrower&rsquo;s social as well as financial performance. Globally, SLL volume was estimated to be $143 billion in 2019, a large increase from $49 billion in 2018 and $5 billion in 2017, when the products first entered the market<span style="font-size: 12px;"><sup>1</sup></span>.</p>
<p style="color: #f16522; line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 24px;">The latest development in the loan markets has been the broadening of KPIs to include social and governance goals beyond environmental ones&mdash;adding the &ldquo;SG&rdquo; to the leading &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The specific KPIs of an SLL should be unique to each borrower, as the intent is to create incentives to address issues that are material to a borrower&rsquo;s specific business, industry and circumstance. For example, Brookfield Renewable Partners&rsquo; January 2020 SLL tracks the company&rsquo;s production capacity of renewable and clean electricity as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Target levels for pricing reduction are generally based on the borrower&rsquo;s recent actual results for the relevant KPI with negotiated levels of improvement. Most SLLs have had relatively short terms (generally one to three years), which has fostered the development of tangible, near-term KPI targets. While there are no market standards for developing or monitoring KPIs as of yet, lenders generally require third-party verification of KPIs on closing and target testing dates, particularly for private companies lacking relevant public disclosure.</p>
<p>While the magnitude of pricing reductions has varied from deal to deal, potential reductions have generally been meaningful to date. The development of SLLs greatly broadened the scope of potential borrowers from green loans&mdash;while only a limited number of corporate borrowers have significant green capital projects to finance, every corporate borrower has areas of its businesses where it can reduce its environmental impact. Given the broader scope of potential borrowers, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the volume of SLLs has grown to far exceed that of green loans<span style="font-size: 12px;"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<h3 style="color: #002b51;">Expanding scope</h3>
<p>The latest development in the loan markets has been the broadening of KPIs to include social and governance goals beyond environmental ones&mdash;adding the &ldquo;SG&rdquo; to the leading &ldquo;E&rdquo;. Examples include injury incidence rate (Ontario Power Generation Inc.), higher share of management positions held by women (WSP Global Inc., a leading Canadian engineering and design services firm), Indigenous cultural awareness and mental health and first-aid training (Downer EDI, an Australian engineering firm), and percentage of equity holdings meeting a broad set of ESG goals (Neuberger Berman, a U.S. asset manager). Some of these precedents include a mix of environmental and social KPIs. These loans suggest that the basic framework of SLLs can be replicated to address an unlimited scope of ESG issues as long as they can be tracked as numerical KPIs.</p>
<p>Lenders are also increasingly focused on ESG issues even in connection with loans that do not have KPI-linked structures. ESG matters have become a focus of due diligence, for example. Accordingly, the distinction between ESG and non-ESG loans is eroding, and, increasingly, lenders are viewing ESG matters as a key element of corporate performance. In that sense, all corporate loans will be ESG loans in the near future.</p>

Investments in ESG often require trade-offs, and the most productive investments appear calibrated to ESG factors that are highly relevant to the business in question, such as environmental protection for a natural resources company, or customer privacy and data security factors for a technology company.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EA purposive approach to defining material ESG factors\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAssessing the materiality of ESG factors is not always easy, if for no other reason than the number of factors from which to choose. For example, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has published a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmateriality.sasb.org\u002F\"\u003EMateriality Map\u003C\u002Fa\u003E highlighting 26 sustainability issues that are reasonably likely to have a material impact for different businesses in different sectors. Furthermore, the evaluation of ESG risks, opportunities and priorities crosses a wide range of disciplines and expertise and requires collaboration among many different functional groups within an organization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat can help a company prioritize investments in ESG? Drawing on extensive evidence, Professor Alex Edmans of the London Business School makes the case for defining an organization&rsquo;s purpose in society: why the enterprise exists, and who it serves. In his view, establishing purpose is critical to expanding the total value of the enterprise, so that both investor and stakeholder value increases in the long term. For example, an energy company&rsquo;s purpose could be &ldquo;creating automotive fuel that results in a net reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions&rdquo;, whereas a pharmaceutical company could be &ldquo;creating innovative medicine that is accessible to the broadest possible population&rdquo;. Even these simple examples show how a purpose can act as a signpost, implicitly setting priorities and engendering tradeoffs. In this way, says Edmans, a purpose can help organizations answer questions such as: which stakeholders are material to the business? Which stakeholders should the organization be especially concerned about? Answering these questions can guide decisions about which ESG factors are material, and in turn shed light on the ESG investments that are most likely to increase value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA focus on an organization&rsquo;s social value, Edmas posits, &ldquo;is neither defensive nor simply &lsquo;worthy&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s good business.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;The highest-quality evidence, not wishful thinking, supports this conclusion: to reach the land of profit, follow the road of purpose&rdquo;\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E. Or, as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated, &ldquo;purpose is not the sole pursuit of profits but the animating force for achieving them&rdquo;\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EEffective ESG integration and communication\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, once established, a purpose must be integrated and communicated well to be effective. According to one study, those companies found to have a strong and clearly communicated purpose beat the market by 5.9% to 7.6% per year, controlling for risk\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E6\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E. This finding is at the heart of the ESG project. When embedding a purpose with a business, and communicating it both internally and externally, companies can use a wide array of ESG standards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, although there is no single universally accepted standard for evaluating and disclosing ESG factors, there are nonetheless several well recognized standards and bodies, such as SASB, the Global Reporting Initiative, CDP Global, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, Climate Disclosure Standards Board and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). There has been significant pressure from companies, investors, regulators and the accounting firms to harmonize the complicated maze of standards, and we expect this progress to continue following recent announcements by several organizations to create a comprehensive reporting system, and following the announced merger of SASB and IIRC to form the Value Reporting Foundation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are becoming legal considerations as well, with ESG considerations increasingly embedded in financing agreements and transaction documents, board decision-making and public disclosure requirements, which are being strengthened in many jurisdictions. Companies are being held to higher standards of accountability and subject to increasing criticism and activism where they have failed to deliver on their ESG promises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the evidence suggests that a clear purpose&mdash;one that defines an organization&rsquo;s role in society&mdash;can guide the integration of ESG factors into corporate decision-making in a way that increases both investor and stakeholder value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E_________________________\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E M.

Some argue for unbundling climate change from other ESG factors, citing the distinct nature of climate risks relative to other important social and governance issues. Climate events can directly and immediately impact safety and physical assets (e.g., due to more frequent severe storms and wildfires), such that long-term sustainability often takes a backseat to the urgency of immediate adaptation or recovery efforts. Some also argue that corporate sustainability goals based on a grouping of ESG criteria could inadvertently dilute awareness of specific climate risks.

In situations where Glass Lewis believes that a company has not properly managed or mitigated environmental or social risks to the detriment of shareholder value, Glass Lewis may recommend that shareholders vote against the members of the board who are responsible for oversight of environmental and social risks.

In evaluating board and management performance of their ESG-related duties, investors and other stakeholders generally will not demand perfection, but expect companies to make honest and credible ESG commitments and show meaningful progress toward those objectives. Boards and management may want to improve their internal expertise to understand and guide their evaluation of ESG factors, and may need to engage outside ESG experts and independent evaluations to ensure they have an accurate and well-informed picture of the company&rsquo;s ESG landscape that includes considerations, opportunities and risks across the organization\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E.

Boards should ensure that they have meaningful and regular oversight for the most significant ESG priorities and the plans to address them. There is no one-size-fits-all governance model, but rather it should be adapted to the particular management and board structure to ensure the wide range of ESG priorities have the appropriate degree of prominence in the organizational setting. Companies should consider the proportionality of the ESG considerations and measures to be implemented and allocate capital and resources accordingly.

ESG factors and practices should be broadly integrated into corporate policies, the enterprise risk management framework and training programs. The board and its committees should receive regular reports on material ESG matters to allow them to monitor and measure progress.

As organizations progress in their cultural ESG shift, ESG teams and considerations should not be siloed and separate, but rather have prominence at a strategic level and be centrally integrated across the business and a driving criteria in decision-making.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBudget and capital commitments\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E: the board must allocate resources and capital and align budget planning to achieving the ESG commitments over targeted timelines.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPerformance and compensation criteria\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E: corporate performance indicators and scorecards must be consistent and reflect measurable objectives and targets, and ESG-related performance indicators should be considered across various performance criteria and may need to be rebalanced and upweighted.

Instead, taxpayers are entitled to claim a form of tax depreciation, or &ldquo;capital cost allowance&rdquo; (CCA), in respect of amounts expended on capital properties which are also &ldquo;depreciable properties&rdquo;. Essentially, taxpayers may deduct a percentage of the property&rsquo;s value in respect of notional depreciation every year in which they own the property, until the property is fully depreciated. The percentage amount of CCA that taxpayers can deduct in a given year is set out in the \u003Cem\u003EIncome Tax Regulations \u003C\u002Fem\u003E(the Regulations), and is based on the &ldquo;Class&rdquo;, as set out in the Regulations, which that property falls into. Different Classes allow for depreciation to be claimed on a straight line or declining-balance basis. For example, taxpayers are permitted to deduct up to 20% of the cost of a property belonging to Class 8 on a declining-balance basis in a particular year. Here we examine four CCA Classes which are relevant to renewable energy investments: 43.1, 43.2, 54 and 55.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClass 43.1 includes wind turbines, certain fuel cells, photovoltaic solar conversion equipment, waste fuel systems (i.e., landfill gas, manure and wood waste) and high efficiency co-generation systems. Class 43.1 assets are entitled to a 30% declining-balance CCA rate but are also often eligible for inclusion in Class 43.2, provided they meet certain technical metrics, which has a 50% CCA rate. The &ldquo;specified energy property&rdquo; rules set out in the Regulations should be considered when contemplating Class 43.1 or 43.2 deductions, as these rules may, subject to various exceptions, limit the CCA claimable in a year to the amount of income earned from Class 43.1 or 43.2 properties in that year, notwithstanding the CCA deduction that would otherwise be available.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2019 federal budget introduced 100% CCA Classes (54 and 55), both of which are temporary, for certain zero-emissions automobiles that would otherwise be included in CCA Classes with lower CCA rates. Additionally, taxpayers may deduct up to $55,000 of CCA in respect of Class 54 property, instead of the $30,000 they would otherwise be able to deduct. This high CCA rate will remain in place for vehicles that become available for use in a business between March 19, 2019, until the end of 2023, after which they will be phased out until vehicles that become available for use in 2028, or later, will not be eligible. This budget also introduced GST\u002FHST measures to increase the amount of GST\u002FHST that businesses can recover in respect of zero-emissions passenger vehicles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003ECanadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE)\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, expenses incurred to develop a capital property (including depreciable property) will not be deductible under the Tax Act but will be added to that property&rsquo;s tax cost (which typically results in a lower capital gain when the property is eventually sold, or, if the property is depreciable property, more CCA once the property becomes available for use or). However, if an expense is incurred to develop depreciable property, and at least 50% of that depreciable property is Class 43.1 or 43.2 property, the costs incurred in the development may be immediately deductible as CRCE. Any amounts in excess of income earned in the year can generally be carried forward and deducted against income in subsequent years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECertain &ldquo;principal business corporations&rdquo; can also issue &ldquo;flow-through shares&rdquo; (FTS) instead of deducting CRCE or carrying it forward.

Therefore, acquirors are becoming more focused on their ability to comply with such disclosure requirements and the risk of liability for misstatements or omissions on ESG matters. Similarly, lenders are increasingly incorporating ESG disclosure obligations as conditions of their loan agreements.

Although there is no single universally accepted ESG standard, various widely recognized standards have been established by the IFC, Global Reporting Initiative, CDP, Climate Disclosure Standards Board and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (which is merging with the International Integrated Reporting Council) and efforts are underway to merge the latter five standards into a cohesive framework. Where financing is contemplated from the IFC or organizations that have adopted the Equator Principles, consideration should be given to meeting the diligence requirements of those applicable standards. In addition, many banks and other financial institutions have their own special ESG diligence requirements.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe physical and transitional risks associated with climate change. As climatic impacts intensify, transaction parties are increasingly looking to understand how these impacts might impair the value of a target&rsquo;s physical and financial assets, and the steps being taken to mitigate these risks. Transaction parties are also increasingly focused on transitional risks, most notably the risk to a target arising from carbon pricing and other regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe target&rsquo;s community engagement to determine the nature of its interaction and engagement with local communities and other stakeholders, whether there are significant issues and how those groups feel about the target company and the influence of the company&rsquo;s local operations.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe rights and interests of, and impact on, local Indigenous groups as well as compliance with the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), including the principle of free, prior and informed consent.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMatters relating to environmental compliance, antibribery and corruption, human rights, labour standards and supply chains.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the case of operations abroad, especially in developing countries, specific country and local risks and the nature of relationships with government and local partners.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile diligence in these areas often focuses on downside risks, upside value creation opportunities should also be considered and identified.

For example, representations and warranties could be included regarding compliance with specific codes or principles that the target has undertaken to voluntarily comply with&mdash;such as in the case of precious metals miners, compliance with the Responsible Gold Mining Principles developed by the World Gold Council, or in the case of certain carbon intensive companies, compliance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related financial disclosures.

Another key priority will be ensuring that the target&rsquo;s culture of ESG compliance meets the expectations of the acquiror. The acquiror should ensure that appropriate ESG policies of an equivalent scope and standard are implemented by the target, communicated effectively to relevant employees, shareholders and stakeholders, and enforced by management. A merger or acquisition may also present the opportunity for the acquiror to leverage best practices from the target, if the target&rsquo;s ESG policies and achievements are stronger in certain areas, or to seize on ESG-related opportunities presented by the target&rsquo;s reputation and performance in the area.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAppropriate consideration and management of ESG issues has risen to be an area of critical importance to M&amp;A transactions.

technologies. They have also progressed their objectives in terms of broader ESG trends, toward improved environmental performance, relationships with Indigenous groups, employee safety, and diversity in corporate governance structures. With these industry trends set to continue, investors with a holistic view of ESG indicators may do well to keep watch on the opportunities that are being cultivated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EGlobal industry response\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobally, the fossil fuel industry has addressed the increasing importance of ESG in different ways. In Europe there has been a significant focus on environmental impacts, with less emphasis to date on the social and governance factors. European majors, such as BP, Shell and Total, have publicly stated their intention to transform their businesses to align with a global transition to renewable energy sources. Recent investments from these players have focused on the power and mobility sectors, including solar, wind and electric vehicle charging networks. In contrast, investments in renewables and other low carbon technologies by U.S. majors, such as Chevron and ExxonMobil, have been less common. However, it appears that may be starting to shift with ExxonMobil announcing the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions which will initially focus on carbon capture and storage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"color: #f16522; line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 24px;\"\u003EThe Canadian energy sector has and is continuing to invest heavily in diverse and low-carbon energy and clean technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a characteristically Canadian approach, Canadian producers have sought a middle ground&mdash;recognizing that the long-term growth in global energy demand will require a combination of conventional and renewable energy sources for decades to come, they have continued to grow production while improving their ESG profile across environmental, social and governance factors, positioning the sector as the responsible energy supplier of choice on a global scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003ECanadian challenges, innovation and opportunity\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECanadian producers have faced many unique challenges within the global fossil fuel industry. The oil sands in Western Canada have long been the subject of well-organized and well-funded campaigns by climate change advocacy groups that resulted in significant reputational damage. More recently, companies have had to adjust to carbon taxes and new regulations, including clean fuel standards and the Canadian government&rsquo;s recently announced climate plan that will see the carbon tax surge, from $50 per tonne in 2022 to $170 per tonne by 2030. Furthermore, oil and gas exploration and production by its nature engages a number of other ESG criteria, including appropriate environmental practices; employee safety; Indigenous and community engagement; anti-corruption practices; ESG disclosure practices; and regulatory compliance generally. Companies that fail to innovate and adapt to the changing legal and social realities will find themselves struggling to stay competitive. These realities will continue to drive financing, deal-making and energy sector investments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003ECorporate transactions\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs well as being vital to corporate values and reputation, ESG factors are now driving value for strategic corporate transactions. For example, ARC and Seven Generations, which have the two lowest GHG emissions intensities among their Canadian exploration and production peer group, recently announced a strategic combination, elevating the combined company&rsquo;s status as an ESG leader. Similarly, Crescent Point&rsquo;s recent acquisition of Shell&rsquo;s Kaybob Duvernay assets allowed it to enhance its ESG profile through the addition of assets with a low standing well count, minimal reclamation and a low emissions intensity. We expect ESG factors to continue playing an important role in the ongoing consolidation occurring in the Western Canadian energy sector.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003ELow-carbon investments\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Canadian energy sector has and is continuing to invest heavily in diverse and low-carbon energy and clean technology. For example, oil sands companies are global leaders in research and development spending on a per barrel basis, having invested over $1 billion per year since 2012. Through the deployment of new technologies and other efficiencies, oil sands GHG intensity has declined by over 20% over the last decade and is expected to further decline over the next decade aided by enhanced recovery and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). For example, the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line captures and transports CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C\u002Fsub\u003E to be used in enhanced oil recovery before being ultimately stored. This project alone can capture 20% of all current oil sands CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C\u002Fsub\u003E emissions and involves a number of system partners, including Enhance Energy, Wolf Midstream (backed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board), North West Redwater Partnership (owned by North West Refining Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Limited) and Nutrien. There remains ample CO\u003Csub\u003E2 \u003C\u002Fsub\u003Estorage capacity in Western Canada to develop additional CCUS projects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGovernments across Canada, in conjunction with various oil and gas companies, are also developing and investing in hydrogen strategies that will help Canada meet its own emissions targets and position Canada to be a global supplier of hydrogen. The Canadian energy sector&rsquo;s vast knowledge of and experience with CCUS, along with its abundant natural gas reserves, create an ideal environment for Canada to become a leading supplier of blue hydrogen. The industry&rsquo;s advanced development of renewable resource projects combined with ample water supply and access, makes it well positioned to be a leading supplier of green hydrogen as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order for companies to meet their announced emissions reduction targets (a number of which include a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050), and with the announced surge in carbon taxes, the industry will be incentivized to invest in these and other low-carbon energy and clean technology. This will present opportunities for financial investors looking to partner with strategics on projects intended to advance their ESG performance mandates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EIndigenous participation\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the last few years, a number of companies have offered equity partnerships to Indigenous groups instead of (or in addition to) other means of involvement, including impact benefit agreements (read more in &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"\u002Four-latest-thinking\u002Fpublications\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fesg-and-indigenous-communities-the-need-to-focus-on-relationships\"\u003EESG and Indigenous communities – the need to focus on relationships\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo;). This has particularly been the case for pipelines and other linear projects that affect aboriginal and\u002For treaty rights. For example, TC Energy&rsquo;s Keystone XL pipeline had an agreement with Natural Law Energy, an alliance of First Nations, to invest up to $1 billion in Keystone XL. Other high-profile projects like the Coastal GasLink Pipeline and the Alaska to Alberta Railway are also offering equity partnerships to First Nations. Equity participation serves to align the interests of industry and Indigenous groups in the continued development of Canada&rsquo;s natural resources in a manner which is responsive to the rights and interests of affected Indigenous groups, and we expect that Indigenous groups will grow their participation in projects across the industry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EDiversity and inclusion factors\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECanadian energy companies are also setting progressive, clear and measurable targets for diversity. Many of these targets focus on board diversity, although some go further. Enbridge, for example, has set targets for diversity in its workforce including gender, racial and ethnic diversity, people with disabilities and veterans. These kinds of measurable targets help keep Canadian energy companies accountable and achieving these targets will be crucial to passing scrutiny from governments, regulators, and investors moving forward.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EThe road ahead for ESG in oil and gas\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECanadian oil and gas companies have made great strides on the ESG front and continue to demonstrate their commitment to operating to the highest environmental, social and governance standards. While the industry is uniquely situated to develop a number of capital-intensive clean energy technologies such as CCUS, hydrogen, biofuels, offshore wind and battery storage, it is important to understand that traditional oil and gas production and consumption is expected to dominate the world energy supply mix for decades to come. The strong commitment from the Canadian energy sector to achieve world class ESG standards, paired with Canada&rsquo;s abundant natural resources, positions Canadian energy companies to be a responsible global energy supplier of choice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"Date":{"value":"2021-03-23T05:00:00Z"},"Authors":"{1CEAA472-DB7E-4B55-AF3B-6E86FD90E3E4}|{CCB894EE-7C25-4329-B104-18B0D1DA936A}|{B919DA1A-4493-45E6-8AA0-28B1302B4FB1}","RelatedPeople":"{1CEAA472-DB7E-4B55-AF3B-6E86FD90E3E4}|{CCB894EE-7C25-4329-B104-18B0D1DA936A}|{B919DA1A-4493-45E6-8AA0-28B1302B4FB1}","RelatedFeaturedPeople":"{1CEAA472-DB7E-4B55-AF3B-6E86FD90E3E4}|{CCB894EE-7C25-4329-B104-18B0D1DA936A}","RelatedServices":[]}},{"id":"b18a54ef-1416-4df1-84ef-aeea960a6f0c","url":"\u002Four-latest-thinking\u002Fpublications\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fin-pursuit-of-a-climate-change-risk-framework-for-canadas-financial-institutions","name":"In pursuit of a climate change risk framework for Canadas financial institutions","displayName":"In pursuit of a climate change risk framework for Canada’s financial institutions","fields":{"TableOfContentsArticles":"{1C521A47-487E-4BF6-9F92-2EEBF74673F1}|{7D745C0F-A9BC-42D0-BC54-0350BD902BA4}|{DC1D2A9D-C3DE-42DF-8B63-045D45ECEE15}|{DFF3FC17-0D9A-4EAE-90CD-C4BFE5F7D763}|{2C0F5FAA-B621-4040-BA1E-41AAF0F5CAEF}|{91BC07E7-7D5C-4641-BE8F-0239E0EAFD37}|{7C439F7E-D2E1-4E21-B714-B3C5DC02AE00}|{27215347-EC68-4762-9E4E-B3EF265F8FB6}|{A135AE95-299D-4380-BE5A-62930E7E512B}|{3FBB8E45-26B2-4442-BC94-39EEE8C44EF1}|{12CFEA92-A580-4506-9747-0E3DB108BEB1}","Tags":"{76A927D2-D9C8-4307-B0C0-EA7ADCE4537D}|{F03502DF-ED54-43A7-9517-D108CA25C932}|{68352F43-962F-425D-A44A-1589CF8B6C15}|{117F6B21-F85D-4EBD-885D-6A0393C0D16E}","SubTags":[],"MetaDescription":{"value":""},"MetaTitle":{"value":""},"MetaImage":{"value":{}},"Page Design":null,"HideCardTeaserDate":{"value":false},"TeaserDescription":{"value":""},"TeaserTitle":{"value":"In pursuit of a climate change risk framework for Canada’s financial institutions"},"TeaserDisplayDate":{"value":""},"TeaserTemplateTypeOverride":{"value":""},"TeaserImage":{"value":{"src":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.torys.com\u002F-\u002Fmedia\u002Fimages\u002Finsights\u002Fgeneric-3,-d-,4.jpg?h=1125&iar=0&w=2000&hash=9C9A19900F010B035502BE8930B1F905","alt":"","width":"2000","height":"1125"}},"TeaserDate":{"value":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"FeaturedTeaserDescription":{"value":""},"FeaturedTeaserTitle":{"value":""},"ExternallySearchable":{"value":true},"BioPageOnly":{"value":false},"NotNavigatable":{"value":false},"IncludeInSearch":{"value":true},"Priority":"{19F3E919-4991-495F-9207-E1DADFD06F54}","ChangeFrequency":"{D23B4654-53A5-4589-8B1B-5665A763D144}","SourceUrl":{"value":""},"OtherAuthors":{"value":""},"SharepointId":{"value":null},"Source":{"value":""},"Title":{"value":"In pursuit of a climate change risk framework for Canada’s financial institutions"},"Subtitle":{"value":""},"Abstract":{"value":"Abstract"},"Description":{"value":"\u003Cp class=\"primary\"\u003EWhile the pandemic occupied the attention of governments, businesses, and the public throughout 2020, environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change, also continued to receive significant attention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll indications suggest that ESG issues will remain at the forefront in 2021, and for the Canadian financial services sector, recent climate change-related initiatives by regulators and government, as well as industry participants, demonstrate this ongoing focus.

An in-depth survey by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada of financial services market providers (including institutional investors with assets under management totaling approximately $1.9 trillion) revealed that investors want increased, relevant, and timely disclosure about governance, high-level risk management, and strategic assessment in relation to climate change risk.

Non-bank lenders are also motivated by a shift in institutional investors&rsquo; thinking on ESG issues from avoiding a prescribed set of harmful industries, such as fossil fuels, to actively seeking out a broader range of borrowers that are contributing to a sustainable, progressive or green economy. Borrowers can take advantage of this increased demand to reach additional sources of debt capital, lower their borrowing costs and enhance their broader corporate and public reputation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EThe evolution of green loans\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe loan market&rsquo;s first ESG product was the &ldquo;green loan&rdquo;, a loan in which the permitted use of proceeds is limited to funding environmentally positive projects or initiatives (read &ldquo;\u003Ca href=\"\u002Four-latest-thinking\u002Fpublications\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fgreen-bonds-and-beyond-sustainable-finance-in-the-capital-markets\"\u003EGreen bonds and beyond: sustainable finance in the capital markets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&rdquo; for a broad survey of sustainable financing trends). An example is the loan to finance the construction of the Tapestry at Victoria Harbour, an energy efficient residential development in British Columbia. While the scope of acceptable green projects is broad, including corporate initiatives to increase energy efficiency or reduce waste as well as more prototypical renewable energy project financings, the focus of green loans is limited to environmental sustainability issues, a subset of the broader ESG universe.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the last few years, much of the loan market&rsquo;s ESG focus has shifted to sustainability linked loans (SLL). SLLs are loans for general corporate purposes so proceeds are not limited to funding green projects or initiatives. Instead, the loans periodically track specified sustainability-based key performance indicators (KPIs) and measure them against pre-negotiated targets and reward (or punish) borrowers for their progress with interest rate adjustments. This approach fits into the basic architecture for interest rate step-downs and step-ups that track financial-based adjustments (such as those based on leverage) that have long been prevalent in the loan market. Supplementing financial metrics with ESG-based KPIs in setting margins (a proxy for the lenders&rsquo; perceived risk of repayment) demonstrates that lenders are placing a value on borrower&rsquo;s social as well as financial performance. Globally, SLL volume was estimated to be $143 billion in 2019, a large increase from $49 billion in 2018 and $5 billion in 2017, when the products first entered the market\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"color: #f16522; line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 24px;\"\u003EThe latest development in the loan markets has been the broadening of KPIs to include social and governance goals beyond environmental ones&mdash;adding the &ldquo;SG&rdquo; to the leading &ldquo;E&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe specific KPIs of an SLL should be unique to each borrower, as the intent is to create incentives to address issues that are material to a borrower&rsquo;s specific business, industry and circumstance. For example, Brookfield Renewable Partners&rsquo; January 2020 SLL tracks the company&rsquo;s production capacity of renewable and clean electricity as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Target levels for pricing reduction are generally based on the borrower&rsquo;s recent actual results for the relevant KPI with negotiated levels of improvement. Most SLLs have had relatively short terms (generally one to three years), which has fostered the development of tangible, near-term KPI targets. While there are no market standards for developing or monitoring KPIs as of yet, lenders generally require third-party verification of KPIs on closing and target testing dates, particularly for private companies lacking relevant public disclosure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the magnitude of pricing reductions has varied from deal to deal, potential reductions have generally been meaningful to date. The development of SLLs greatly broadened the scope of potential borrowers from green loans&mdash;while only a limited number of corporate borrowers have significant green capital projects to finance, every corporate borrower has areas of its businesses where it can reduce its environmental impact. Given the broader scope of potential borrowers, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the volume of SLLs has grown to far exceed that of green loans\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 12px;\"\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\"color: #002b51;\"\u003EExpanding scope\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe latest development in the loan markets has been the broadening of KPIs to include social and governance goals beyond environmental ones&mdash;adding the &ldquo;SG&rdquo; to the leading &ldquo;E&rdquo;. Examples include injury incidence rate (Ontario Power Generation Inc.), higher share of management positions held by women (WSP Global Inc., a leading Canadian engineering and design services firm), Indigenous cultural awareness and mental health and first-aid training (Downer EDI, an Australian engineering firm), and percentage of equity holdings meeting a broad set of ESG goals (Neuberger Berman, a U.S. asset manager). Some of these precedents include a mix of environmental and social KPIs. These loans suggest that the basic framework of SLLs can be replicated to address an unlimited scope of ESG issues as long as they can be tracked as numerical KPIs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELenders are also increasingly focused on ESG issues even in connection with loans that do not have KPI-linked structures. ESG matters have become a focus of due diligence, for example. Accordingly, the distinction between ESG and non-ESG loans is eroding, and, increasingly, lenders are viewing ESG matters as a key element of corporate performance.
