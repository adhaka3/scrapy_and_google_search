Sustainable Finance
Creating a healthier and more equitable future for all will take the combined efforts of nonprofits, governments and the private sector. Bank of America is marshalling its global resources to help.
Environmental transition Inclusive development Services and expertise
A healthier, more inclusive future From providing clean water to an estimated 80 million people who lack it, to leading the fight against climate change, to addressing critical social issues such as affordable housing and healthcare, the world’s greatest challenges are daunting. At the same time, overcoming them has never been more attainable. Through the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global leaders have created a roadmap to make and measure progress on today’s most urgent environmental and social issues. Bank of America is committed to helping lead this transition. As part of our support for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we develop innovative investments that put global capital to work on critical environmental problems, by supporting prosperity in the communities we serve, and by being a more sustainable company in everything we do to ensure a better and more sustainable future for all. The two main pillars of our business are: Environmental Transition Addressing climate change and promoting the circular economy, including solutions for renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, water & sanitation, sustainable agriculture, and carbon capture & sequestration

Environmental Transition The world has trillions of dollars in capital that can be innovatively used in investments targeting environmental needs--while generating a return for investors. Global financial institutions are uniquely positioned to lead the way, both by deploying their own capital and by attracting capital from investors around the world. Bank of America has committed $1 trillion in low-carbon, sustainable business initiatives through 2030 as part of its Environmental Business Initiative. This commitment advances an environmental transition across sectors to solutions in energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable transportation, resource efficiency, sustainable water and agriculture as well as improved forestry and pollution control measures. And we’re using our investment and consulting expertise to develop innovative approaches to address the SDGs at a global scale.

Inclusive Development Challenges such as affordable housing and access to education are global in nature, but their affects are felt in local communities by neighbors, peers and coworkers — which is why for businesses to be successful, the communities they serve need be successful. To help ensure success for all, additional resources are needed to advance racial equality and economic opportunity. Bank of America is innovating ways to amplify investment in local communities as well as programs to build job skills, professional training and career pathways. We’ve issued $13.85 billion in sustainability and equality bonds, focused on: jobs initiatives in Black and Hispanic-Latino Communities, increased access to healthcare in underserved and minority communities, investments in Minority Deposit Institutions, and deploying capital to minority entrepreneurs, business and funds. In addition to being one of the largest affordable housing investors and lenders in the U.S., we are proud to be the largest private sector lender to Community Development Financial Institutions.
