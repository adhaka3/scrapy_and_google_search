ESG and green finance
ESG and green finance are gaining momentum, driven by international initiatives to tackle climate change and promote sustainable development, growing investor appetite, and the recognition of the critical role which sustainability plays in a resilient global financial system. The effect of this reorientation of capital is beginning to be felt across all asset classes and in all jurisdictions.
Our ESG and green finance webinar series will assist financial institutions, corporates and investors to navigate developments in sustainable finance and in the ESG landscape.
Topics
