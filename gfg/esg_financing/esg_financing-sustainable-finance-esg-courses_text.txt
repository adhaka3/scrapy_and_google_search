Best Sustainable Finance/ ESG Courses & Certifications (2023)In
Finance Courses & Certifications by Gaurav SharmaUpdated On: January 3rd, 2023As per a recent HSBC survey, 89% of institutional investors believe that social and environmental issues are important to them. Its apparent that ESG is increasingly becoming a core part of investment policy and philosophy with firms scrambling to find experts with the skills and knowledge to help formulate and implement their ESG policies. This trend will continue for the coming decades and anyone not onboard is likely to be left behind.This shift in priorities is mostly led by a generation of highly educated and environmentally conscious professionals and it’s a cause that I personally champion as well. The financial services industry has to transition with the times, and it is up to us to lead that change. These courses and certifications have been designed to teach the principles and concepts of sustainable finance and ESG Investing and help you become a leader in the field.1. Sustainable Finance from University of CambridgeWho is this for?This course focuses on both the macro and micro level of sustainable finance which means it is well suited for professionals at all levels of experience.

This includes value creation, risks that were previously ignored, systematic thinking and a departure from “short-termism”. Its a fresh take and I hope this starts being reinforced at business schools too.The public sector also gets a lot of attention which is good to see as governments have a key role in leading the change because of the social impact of sustainable finance.If you are looking for a personal branding boost, Cambridge is of course a great brand to have on any CV or LinkedIn profile.Click here and use code GS-AF-BBD15 for a 15% discount on this course!SummaryDuration6 weeks, about 7 hours a weekFormatSelf-paced, fully onlineDifficultyExecutiveCertificate of CompletionYes 2.

Environmental Social & Governance (ESG) Specialization from CFICourse ReviewThe Corporate Finance Institute is a leader in financial education and offers several high-profile financial certifications. This particular ESG specialization is one of their newer offerings, but it is backed by a lot of experience in providing quality financial training. Their reputation in the industry reflects positively on everyone who has a CFI certification on their LinkedIn profiles or Resume.There are seven modules or courses that make up the certification. You start off with a general introduction to ESG that teaches you the fundamentals. These modules cover a lot of ground and cover topics ranging from ESG disclosures to financial analysis. ESG disclosures need to be well made and you will learn the best practices so that ESG risks can be properly understood.ESG investing is the next area of focus, and a lot of time is spend explaining novel concepts that even finance pros will find useful. You will learn how ESG factors and initiative impact financial performance, how to model these into a financial model, how to objectively measure their effects and so on. Such concepts are always tricky in finance but CFI has done a good job of making them objectively measurable enough to be part of an Excel model. There is also a pretty massive case study here that really drives home the point.The last few modules cover greenhouse gas accounting, carbon markets, human capital management and other such novel concepts. You are pretty much at the bleeding edge of finance here as these are ideas that are just being explored and experimented on. The consensus is yet to be built on how these should be evaluated and now is your time to get in.Learning about sustainable finance and ESG is our opportunity to feel what it is like being on the ground floor of a revolution in finance. Which is why I highly recommend this course to anyone genuinely interested in the future and shaping the industry.Click here and use code BBD10 for a 10% discount!SummaryDuration30-35 hoursFormatSelf-paced, fully onlineDifficultyIntermediateCertificate of CompletionYes4.
