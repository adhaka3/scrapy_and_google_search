Nomura Group believes that the social mission of the financial services sector is to contribute to economic growth and sustainable social development by facilitating the appropriate flow of funds in the capital markets through products and services that meet the needs of customers. In addition, to fulfill our responsibility as a company that operates globally, we offer financial services that contribute to addressing climate change and social issues and promote initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Addressing Environmental and Social Issues through Financing Support
Through underwriting SDG bonds, Nomura serves as a bridge between investors who want to contribute to society and projects with capital needs that aim to resolve social issues such as climate change. Nomura Group is engaged in sustainable finance in Japan and overseas, and is contributing to the achievement of SDGs using capital markets.
In 2017, Nomura Securities established a team dedicated to working on ESG bonds in the Debt Capital Markets Dept., and in 2018 the team got stronger by establishing a global structure. In 2022, we established the Sustainable Finance Department to further strengthen initiatives for sustainability-related businesses. Utilizing a platform built in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and around the world, it delivers optimal solutions overseas for ESG bond issuance.
In Japan, Nomura Securities underwrote Green Bonds issued by NTT Finance Corporation and Sustainability Bonds (Toyota Woven Planet Bond) issued by Toyota Motor Corporation in 2021, and Green Bonds issued by Kansai Electric Power Company and Fukuoka city, Transition Bonds issued by JFE and Social Bonds issued by Welfare And Medical Service Agency in 2022. Nomura Securities actively underwrite SDG bonds not only in Japan but also overseas to share market conditions and provide customers with useful information and proposals.
Nomura Securities was allotted the world's first Sustainable FITs (stock acquisition rights). Airtech Japan's stock acquisition rights are the first in the world in the form of equity financing to receive a second opinion from an evaluation organization from the perspective of ESG and SDGs, in the belief that the use and significance of the funds will contribute to the reduction of environmental impact through energy conservation and the resolution of social problems such as infectious disease countermeasures.

Strengthening Sustainability-Related Advisory and Financing Services
Nomura will provide solutions in sustainability-related fields in light of growing demand for sustainable products and social needs. We will continue to invest in growth areas and help our clients address their new needs.
Providing M&A Advisory Services by Nomura Greentech
In April 2020, Nomura Group completed the acquisition of Greentech Capital Advisors, a leading boutique investment banking firm focused on supporting clients across sustainable technology and infrastructure. Under the rebranded Nomura Greentech, we will connect companies working to create sustainable technologies with investors and clients across different geographies to help them incorporate innovation into energy, transportation, food, water and waste infrastructure systems.
In April 2022, we established Greentech Industrials & Infrastructure (GII), a team of approximately 150 bankers, through realigning our existing energy, industrials and sustainability focused sectors, and hiring in focus areas. We are strengthening and promoting M&A advisory services in the sustainability field on a global basis, including support for decarbonization through the restructuring of our clients' business portfolios.
Nomura Greentech
Energy-Related Infrastructure Finance
We established a dedicated energy-related Infrastructure Finance team in New York in 2017. We have been strengthening our Infrastructure & Power Finance (IPF) business, one of our core businesses overseeing sustainable finance globally.
Working to Advance Sustainable Finance
Aiming to advance sustainable finance, we carry out a variety of initiatives, including promoting the establishment of international standards and holding seminars on the topic.
Participation in Rulemaking Process
Our team of professionals collaborates across divisions and geographic borders to gather knowledge, monitor market and regulatory trends and expand our lineup of sustainable financial products and services.
Nomura participates in the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) Climate Transition Finance Working Group and the Social Bond Sustainability Link Bond Working Group. As a member of the Sustainable Bond Market Advisory Group of the London Stock Exchange, Government, and associations related to sustainable finance such as Japan Securities Dealers Association, we are also actively involved in rulemaking in the area of sustainable finance and the revitalization of the sustainable finance sector as a whole.
Enhancing ESG Literacy Through Seminars and Other Efforts
Nomura Group is holding many seminars led by experts in a series about sustainable finance. We are working to expand sustainable finance by providing cutting-edge information to a wide range of clients, including institutional investors and non-financial companies. We are also actively participating in external initiatives aimed at developing the market, such as presenting at international conferences on green bonds. We are also working to disseminate information to a wide range of people in all regions, such as by holding online seminars and conferences.
