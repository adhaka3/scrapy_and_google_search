Sustainable Finance Solutions
Sustainable finance has gained substantial impetus from the UN-sanctioned mandate on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at achieving global economic growth through environmentally and socially sustainable investments. Global businesses have identified a significant opportunity and are committing to sustainable projects and initiatives. Debt financing – particularly green, social and sustainability bonds – has emerged as the most popular means of funding. Sustainability; environmental, social and governance (ESG); and social impact investing would be at the heart of economic recovery from the pandemic. Sustainable finance is set to become the next growth frontier for investment banks, backed by high bond issuance and ESG advisory. Acuity Knowledge Partners enables investment banks and advisory firms to establish and grow their sustainable finance practices by providing a wide range of customised analysis and support. Our support areas cover the entire spectrum of financing products along the sustainable financial investment lifecycle. We play a vital role as a valued partner for investment banks, providing thought leadership, research and analytics as they embark to meet growing demand for sustainable financing.
