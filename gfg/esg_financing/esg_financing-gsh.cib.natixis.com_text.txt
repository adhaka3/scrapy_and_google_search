Brown industries: the Transition TightropeClimate finance will fail in its mission if it continues to leave high emitting industries on its sidelines but a robust approach is necessary. During the whole of 2019, Natixis Green & Sustainable Hub has been developing an in-house methodology fed by market intelligence, investor survey and dialogue with issuers, SPOs providers and think tanks.

Water economyDeciphering the challenges, financing the opportunities
Given the pervasiveness of water in natural processes and human activities, this study uses United Nations’ framework of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as Ariadne's thread to understand how water relates to the functioning of the biosphere and to socio-economic development.
This report has a triple purpose: First, deciphering the main water challenges and risks. Second, understanding the role of institutions, policies and the private sector in turning these challenges into business opportunities. Finally, outlining the role of green & sustainable finance in ensuring that economic activities able to provide solutions for water-related issues have the access to capital at the scale commensurate with the magnitude of these challenges.

OUR FIRST FLAGSHIP REPORTSeptember 2018 marks the 3rd anniversary of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was agreed upon in September 2015 by 193 countries, and has since proven to be a rallying point for governments, businesses and investors. It applies for governments abroad and domestically and for companies inwardly and outwardly. Under conditions we tried to clarify, the 2030 Agenda could serve as unifying framework to tie together the sustainability disparate actions of governments, corporations, entrepreneurs, investors, and NGOs.
On this occasion, Natixis Green & Sustainable Hub’s Center of Expertise releases its first flagship report titled “Solving the Sustainable Development Goals Rubik’s Cube – An impact-based toolkit for issuers and investors”. This publication aims first at spurring methodical innovation. It identifies and proposes actionable tools for embedding SDG footprint assessment into corporate strategy and funding or portfolio management, and avoid evidence less contribution claims.
