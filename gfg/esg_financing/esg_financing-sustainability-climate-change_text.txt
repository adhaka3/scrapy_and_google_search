What is ESG?
The evolution of corporate sustainability
Sustainability emerged as a topic in the 80s from environmental issues to a broader set of subjects. It has evolved from  the “do no harm” and public relations approach of “CSR” to a holistic approach of creating and protecting value through proactive management and reporting of environmental, social and economic impacts as well as stakeholder concerns and expectations. The pursuit of achieving sustainability and alongside with the changing of global era has urged and transformed the investments to be not only financially but also social and environmentally sustainable. Therefore, there is an arising need for the development of a regulatory framework that defines sustainable investments and links Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors in the investment decision–making process and access to funds. Corporate sustainability criteria are now core issues guiding the ever-increasing “sustainable” or “ESG” investing.
Linking Sustainability and CSR to Sustainable investment
Investors are increasingly factoring sustainability considerations into their investment decisions and portfolio management strategies
According to a PwC Private Equity Responsible Investment Survey conducted on 2019, with a total sample of 162 respondents, the following significant results were arisen:
81% of respondents report ESG matters to their Boards at least once a year
67% of respondents have identified and prioritised Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are relevant to their investments (compared to 38% in 2016)
91% of respondents have already adopted or are currently developing a responsible investment or ESG policy
83% of respondents are concerned about climate risks in their portfolio
Linking ESG to financing and investment activities
EU Sustainable Finance Regulation aims to support EU to achieve three ambitious climate and energy targets by 2030.
Targets - Issue - Solution
EU Committed to specific environmental targets
The issue
The solution
EU Committed to specific environmental targets
40%
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990
32%
At least a 32% share of renewables in final energy consumption
30%
At least 30% energy savings compared with the business-as-usual scenario
The issue
The annual EU investment gap to meet these targets is estimated to be between € 175 to 290 billion.
The solution
The financial sector will be part of the solution and will play a critical role in achieving the EU’s sustainability goals. The purpose of the EU Sustainable Finance Regulation is to finance sustainable growth that will help the EU to achieve the 2030 goals.
What are the objectives of the new regulation:
Establish a unified EU classification system of sustainable economic activities (‘taxonomy’).
Improve disclosure requirements on how investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their risk processes.
Create a new category of benchmarks which will help investors compare the carbon footprint of their investments.
Protecting private investors by avoiding risks of green washing.
Providing the basis for further policy action in the area of sustainable finance, including standards, labels, and any potential changes to prudential rules.
Six key elements of the Sustainable finance regulation:
Standards for green financial products
EU Green Bond Standards and ecolabels for financial products, defining minimum ESG requirements and terms.
Report issuance date: By 31/12/2020
Credit Ratings
Guidelines and disclosure requirements for integrating ESG factors into credit ratings by CRAs

EU Green Bond Standards and ecolabels for retail financial products, defining minimum ESG requirements and terms.

ESG requirements and reporting
What will banks and investors request from companies?
Banks and investors will periodically increase their ESG requests. We believe that relevant ESG requirements will evolve in 3 phases. We are now in Phase 1.
Phase 1: Focus in environment
Request annual data mainly related to environmental performance.
Ensure that the investment or activity to be financed complies with all applicable regulations and financing standards (i.e. ESMS)
Phase 2: Disclose complete ESG performance
Incorporate in relevant requests Social and Governance related metrics.
Disclose ESG performance through annual reports.
Develop measures consistent with the industry requirements and comparable over the years.
Perform 3rd party assurance over the respective KPIs.
Phase 3: Improve ESG performance
Establish an ESG strategy, depicting short and long term commitments.
Define an action plan in order to improve ESG performance.
Become taxonomy eligible.
Achieve higher ESG ratings.
Link ESG performance with financing terms.
Why monitor and report ESG performance?
Meet the requirements of investors and financial institutions.
Investors, funds and financial institutions are increasingly taking into consideration the ESG performance of companies. As a result, companies that demonstrate transparency, and good performance in ESG related matters achieve higher ESG ratings and enjoy better access to funding as well as more favorable financing terms.
Access to capital markets.
Investors assessing organizations' sustainability performance in the context of good corporate governance and risk management. The transparency of how (well) an organization is addressing sustainability builds trust with investors. Sustainability performance improves brand and reputation.
Improve performance.
Companies are increasingly trying to improve performance related to issues such as environmental impact, people wellbeing, health and safety and business ethics. It is therefore required to continuously monitor KPIs related to ESG and compare against targets and industry peers.
Gain a competitive advantage.
Companies that understand the implications of sustainability to their business models can use this information to both enhance and develop new products and services. For example (a) first mover advantage and (b) reputational position in new and/or growing markets.
Demonstrate ethical and socially responsible business practices.
At its core, ESG and sustainability promote business ethics and social prosperity, thus adopting and promoting sustainable practices enhances both of these causes and allows companies to obtain a social license to operate.
