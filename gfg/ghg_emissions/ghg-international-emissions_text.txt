Global Emissions
Carbon dioxide emissions, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, have risen dramatically since the start of the industrial revolution. Most of the world’s greenhouse gas  emissions come from a relatively small number of countries. China, the United States, and the nations that make up the European Union are the three largest emitters on an absolute basis. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions are highest in the United States and Russia.
Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 1850–2040
Notes
Note: Carbon dioxide emissions have risen rapidly for the past 70 years. However, they are projected to remain steady, albeit at a very high level, in the coming decades. Emission reductions in developed economies are expected to offset carbon dioxide emission growth in developing countries.
Not shown in this chart, other greenhouse gases (i.e., methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) are expected to increase by 30 percent over the next three decades.

Greenhouse Gas Intensity, 2018
Notes
Greenhouse gas intensity is a measure of the amount of emissions relative to GDP. It is highest in Russia and China with the United States below the world average.

Global Manmade Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector, 2013
Notes
Globally, the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions are electricity and heat (31%), agriculture (11%), transportation (15%), forestry (6%) and manufacturing (12%). Energy production of all types accounts for 72 percent of all emissions.

Global Manmade Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Gas, 2015
Notes
CO2 accounts for about 76 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. Methane, primarily from agriculture, contributes 16 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and nitrous oxide, mostly from industry and agriculture, contributes 6 percent to global emissions. All figures here are expressed in CO2-equivalents.
