Greenhouse gas emissions and projections
Ireland must play its part in contributing to efforts to limit climate change. Ireland’s national policy position establishes a low carbon vision for Ireland by 2050. Ireland has not met its EU Effort Sharing 2020 target. Climate Action Plan measures will need to be swiftly implemented to meet Ireland’s future targets.

-4.9%
Compared to 2020, less homeworking due to the partial lifting of COVID restrictions, warmer winter & increased fuel switching from coal & peat to oil and natural gas
Transport emissions
Emissions increased by 6.1% in 2021 due to partial lifting of COVID restrictions
Transport
+6.1%
Electric vehicles have nearly doubled in 2021 but still account for less than 2% of the fleet
Agriculture
Increased emissions in 2021, driven by increased nitrogen fertiliser use (+5.2% in 2021) and increased numbers of dairy cows (+2.8%)
Agriculture emissions
+3.0%
Overall increase in agriculture emissions
Waste
Emissions from the Waste sector decreased by 4.5% in 2021, with a decrease in sub category; landfills of 5.4%.
Waste sector emissions
-4.5%
Overall decreasing emissions trend
Commercial and Public services
The Commercial/Public services sector estimates emissions from fuel combustion for space and hot water heating in commercial and public buildings in Ireland.
Commercial/Public share
3.4%
COVID restrictions had little impact on commercial or public services sectors
Manufacturing combustion
Emissions from combustion of fuels in manufacturing industry. It also includes combustion for combined heat and power for own use in these industries.
Manufacturing combustion
+0.9%
This sector was responsible for 7.5% of Ireland's total GHG emissions in 2021
Industrial processes
In 2021 the industrial processes sector was responsible for 4.0% and F-gases 1.2% of Ireland's total GHG emissions
Industrial processes
+16.8%
Cement sector process emissions increased by 16.8% in 2021
LULUCF
Forest land, Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements, Other land and Harvested Wood products are included in LULUCF
Latest inventory data for 2021 shows that land use, land use change and forestry activity emit
7.8 Mt CO2eq
This sector is a net source of carbon in all years.
Assessment of compliance
The provisional estimates of greenhouse gas emissions indicate that Ireland exceeds its 2021 annual limit, without the use of flexibilities, set under the EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) by 2.74 Mt CO2eq.
Compliance with national target requires a reduction of
51%
by 2030 compared to 2018.

Key trends in emissions by gas
Emissions by gas type
Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂) accounted for 61.0% of the national total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) of 61,528.1.1 kt CO₂ equivalent in 2021, with CH₄ and N₂O contributing 27.9% and 9.9%, respectively. The combined emissions of HFCs, PFCs, SF₆ and NF₃ accounted for 1.2% of total GHG emissions in 2021.

Emissions by gas 1990-2021
Share by gas
61.0%
Carbon dioxide CO₂ is the most significant contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions of CO₂ are primarily due to combustion of fossil fuels in all sectors.
27.9%
Methane (CH₄) is the second most significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland and is primarily due to the agriculture sector and a the large animal population with a smaller contribution from the waste sector.
9.9%
Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions contribute 9.9% to the national total GHG emissions in 2021. The largest contributor to the trend is the Agriculture sector with 93.6% share of total N₂O emissions in 2021.
1.2%
The combined emissions of HFCs, PFCs, SF₆ and NF₃ accounted for 1.2% of total GHG emissions in 2021. These are mainly attributed to refrigeration and air conditioning emissions.
FAQs on greenhouse gas (GHG)

Climate Change
Ireland's GHG emissions inventory
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol provide the basis for international action to address climate change. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human-induced interference with the climate system. The ability of the international community to achieve this objective is dependent on an accurate knowledge of emissions trends, and on our collective ability to alter these trends. Reliable GHG inventories are essential, both at national and international level. Parties to the convention and its Kyoto Protocol are committed to developing and publishing the national emission inventories of GHGs which is a key element of assessing progress towards meeting commitments and targets.
The EPA has overall responsibility for the national greenhouse gas inventory in Ireland's national system and compiles Ireland's national greenhouse gas emission inventory on an annual basis.
Emissions data for the following gases is reported on an annual basis: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perflurocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
Ireland's GHG emissions projections
The National Climate Change Strategy (2007) designated the EPA with responsibility for developing national emission projections for greenhouse gases for all key sectors of the economy. Emission projections serve to inform national policy initiatives and allow Ireland to comply with EU and UN reporting obligations on emissions projections. The EPA produces national greenhouse gas emission projections on an annual basis.

Popular FAQs
How can I cite these maps?
If you publish a news article, visualization, blog post, or other publication using these maps, please include the link to the Irish Environmental Protection Agency maps page and attribution to the EPA and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Where do the survey data underlying the estimates come from?
The data underlying the maps come from a large national survey dataset (4,000 respondents) collected during May through July of 2021 as part of a collaboration between the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication (YPCCC). Reports using the individual-level survey data are available here:
Climate Change in the Irish Mind report
Climate Change's Four Irelands audience segmentation report
Do these maps reflect changes in opinions due to recent extreme weather events like Storm Ophelia/Storm Barra?
Perhaps. The maps may reflect the impacts that specific extreme weather events had on public opinion in a given geographic unit. If public opinion in a particular area has been influenced by local events it is possible that the model would detect such an influence. However, data from specific events or types of events are not explicitly built into the model as predictor variables.
Do the maps account for differences in population density across the country?
The type of map used in this tool is called a choropleth map, which means the colours on the maps reflect the percentage of the population in a given geographic unit who would answer each question as indicated. These kinds of maps are used to represent everything from election results to census and economic data (e.g., per capita income or unemployment rates). Thus, it is important to keep in mind that some geographic areas may be large, but have few residents (e.g., Mayo), while other geographic areas may be small, but have many residents (e.g., Dublin). For reference, The Central Statistics Office has published the relevant population density information.
What does the grey colour mean on some of the bars beneath the maps?
The grey area reflects people who provided valid responses such as refusal to answer a question, saying they “Don’t know,” or gave an answer that was not modeled (e.g., “Currently doing the right amount”). We do not provide specific values for the grey areas because we did not develop estimates for these particular responses.
