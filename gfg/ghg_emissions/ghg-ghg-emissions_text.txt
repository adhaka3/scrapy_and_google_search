GHG emissions
In 2020, the transport sector added 12 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere, including CO2, N2O, methane, and black carbon. Absent significant policy changes, annual GHG emissions from transportation will soar by 2050 to 21 billion metric tons. However, the ICCT’s policy outline shows how to slash the sector’s GHG output by 8 billion metric tons from the 2020 level.
