		<p>Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.<sup><a href="#t1fn1">1</a></sup> The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.</p>

		<p>EPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing the <em><a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</a></em>. This annual report estimates the total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with human activities across the United States.</p>

		<p>The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are:</p>

		<ul><li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#electricity">Electricity production</a></span> (30 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Electricity production generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 67 percent of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and natural gas.<sup><a href="#t1fn2">2</a></sup></li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#transportation">Transportation</a></span> (26 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation primarily come from burning fossil fuel for our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes. Over 90 percent of the fuel used for transportation is petroleum based, which includes gasoline and diesel.<sup><a href="#t1fn3">3</a></sup></li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#industry">Industry</a></span> (21 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily come from burning fossil fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions necessary to produce goods from raw materials.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#commercial-and-residential">Commercial and Residential</a></span> (12 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from businesses and homes arise primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat, the use of certain products that contain greenhouse gases, and the handling of waste.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#agriculture">Agriculture</a></span> (9 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#land-use-and-forestry">Land Use and Forestry</a></span> (offset of 11 percent of 2014 greenhouse gas emissions) – Land areas can act as a sink (absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere) or a source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, since 1990, managed forests and other lands have absorbed more CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere than they emit.</li>
		</ul><h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>Since 1990, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by about 7 percent. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2014, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased compared to 2013 levels. This increase was due to a number of factors, including: cold winter conditions resulting in an increase in fuel demand, especially in residential and commercial sectors; an increase in transportation emissions resulting from an increase in vehicle miles traveled; and an increase in industrial production across multiple sectors that also resulted in increases in industrial sector emissions.</p>

<a href="/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2016-05/ghge-sources-overview_1.png" target="_blank">Larger image to save or print.</a></span></span>The Electricity sector involves the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#carbon-dioxide">Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, but smaller amounts of <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane">methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</a> and <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide">nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</a> are also emitted. These gases are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. Less than 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector come from <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases">sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)</a>, an insulating chemical used in electricity transmission and distribution equipment.</p>

		<h2>Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Electricity Sector by Fuel Source</h2>

		<p>Coal combustion is generally more carbon intensive than burning natural gas or petroleum for electricity. Although coal accounts for about 77 percent of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the sector, it represents about 39 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. About 27 percent of electricity generated in 2014 was generated using natural gas, an increase relative to 2013. Petroleum accounts for approximately 1 percent of electricity generation. The remaining generation comes from nuclear (about 19 percent) and renewable sources (about 13 percent), which include hydroelectricity, biomass, wind, and solar.<sup><a href="#Electricity ref">1</a></sup> These other sources usually release fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel combustion, if any emissions at all.</p>

		<h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2014, the electricity sector was the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about 30 percent of the U.S. total. Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity have increased by about 12 percent since 1990 as electricity demand has grown and fossil fuels have remained the dominant source for generation.</p>

Therefore, it is possible to attribute the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production to the sectors that use the electricity. Looking at greenhouse gas emissions by end-use sector can help us understand energy demand across sectors and changes in energy use over time.</p>

		<p>When emissions from electricity are allocated to the end-use sector, industrial activities account for a much larger share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from commercial and residential buildings also increase substantially when emissions from electricity are included, due to their relatively large share of electricity consumption (e.g., lighting and appliances).</p>

		<h2>Reducing Emissions from Electricity</h2>

		<p>There are a variety of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. The table shown below categorizes these opportunities and provides examples. For a more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf">Chapter 7</a> of the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/"><em>Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</em></a>. <a class="exit-disclaimer" href="/home/exit-epa" title="EPA's External Link Disclaimer">Exit</a></p>

		<p>Under the president's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/climate-action-plan">Climate Action Plan</a><span>, EPA is taking action to reduce emissions from power plants. </span><a href="/cleanpowerplan">Learn More</a>.</p>

		<p>In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation accounted for about 26 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest contributor of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions after the <span class="menu-internal"><a href="#electricity">Electricity sector</a></span>. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation have increased by about 17 percent since 1990. This historical increase is largely due to increased demand for travel and the limited gains in fuel efficiency across the U.S. vehicle fleet. The number of vehicle miles traveled by passenger cars and light-duty trucks increased 37 percent from 1990 to 2014. The increase in travel miles is attributed to several factors, including population growth, economic growth, urban sprawl, and low fuel prices during the beginning of this period. Between 1990 and 2004, average fuel economy among new vehicles sold annually declined, as sales of light-duty trucks increased. However, new vehicle fuel economy began to improve in 2005, largely due to a lower light-duty truck market share and higher fuel economy standards.</p>

The greenhouse gases emitted during industrial production are split into two categories:<strong> direct emissions</strong> that are produced at the facility, and <strong>indirect emissions</strong> that occur off site, but are associated with the facility's use of energy.</p>

		<p><strong>Direct emissions</strong> are produced by burning fuel for power or heat, through chemical reactions, and from leaks from industrial processes or equipment. Most direct emissions come from the consumption of fossil fuels for energy. A smaller amount, roughly a third, come from leaks from natural gas and petroleum systems, the use of fuels in production (e.g., petroleum products used to make plastics), and chemical reactions during the production of chemicals, iron and steel, and cement.</p>

		<p><strong>Indirect emissions</strong> are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used by an industrial facility to power industrial buildings and machinery.</p>

		<p>More information about facility-level emissions from large industrial sources is available through EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program's <a href="http://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do">data publication tool</a>. National-level information about emissions from industry as a whole can be found in the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">sections on Fossil Fuel Combustion and the Industrial Processes chapter in the </a><em><a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</a>.</em></p>

		<h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2014, direct industrial greenhouse gas emissions accounted for approximately 21 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the third largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, after the <span class="menu-internal"><a href="#electricity">Electricity</a></span> and <span class="menu-internal"><a href="#transportation">Transportation</a></span> sectors. If both direct and indirect emissions associated with electricity use are included, industry's share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 was 29 percent, making it the largest contributor of greenhouse gases of any sector. Greenhouse gas emissions from industry have declined by almost 10 percent since 1990, while emissions from most other sectors have increased.</p>

		<p>Agricultural activities – the cultivation of crops and livestock for food – contribute to emissions in a variety of ways:</p>

		<ul><li>Various management practices for agricultural soils can lead to production and emission of <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide">nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</a>. The large number of different activities that can contribute to N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural lands range from fertilizer application to methods of irrigation and tillage. Management of agricultural soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the Agriculture sector.*</li>
			<li>Livestock, especially cattle, produce <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane">methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</a> as part of their digestion. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents almost one third of the emissions from the Agriculture sector.</li>
			<li>The way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes to CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Manure storage methods and the amount of exposure to oxygen and moisture can affect how these greenhouse gases are produced. Manure management accounts for about 14 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector in the United States.</li>
			<li>Smaller sources of emissions include rice cultivation, which produces CH<sub>4</sub>, and burning crop residues, which produce CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
		</ul><p>More national-level information about emissions from agriculture can be found in the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">agriculture chapter in the </a><em><a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</a>.</em></p>

		<p>* Management of agricultural soils can also lead to emissions of <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a>. However, these emissions are included under the <span class="menu-internal"><a href="#land-use-and-forestry">Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector</a></span>.</p>

		<h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture accounted for approximately 9 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have increased by approximately 11 percent since 1990. One driver for this increase has been the 54 percent growth in combined CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from livestock manure management systems, reflecting the increased use of emission-intensive liquid systems over this time period. Emissions from agricultural soil management have also increased by about 5 percent since 1990. Emissions from other agricultural sources have either remained flat or changed by a relatively small amount since 1990.</p>

		<h2>Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Sector Emissions</h2>

		<p>Plants absorb <a href="/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> from the atmosphere as they grow, and they store some of the carbon throughout their lifetime. Soils can also store CO<sub>2</sub>, depending on how the soil is managed. This storage of carbon in plants and soils is called biological carbon sequestration. Because biological sequestration takes CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere, it is also called a greenhouse gas "sink."</p>

		<p>Emissions or sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> can occur as land uses change. For example, CO<sub>2</sub> is exchanged between the atmosphere and the plants and soils on land as former cropland is converted into grassland, as new areas are cultivated and become cropland, or as forests grow. In addition, using biological feedstocks (such as energy crops or wood) for purposes such as electricity generation, input to processes that create liquid fuels, or building materials can lead to emissions or sequestration.</p>

		<p>In the United States overall, since 1990, land use, land-use change, and forestry activities have resulted in more removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere than emissions. Because of this, the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector in the United States is considered a net sink, rather than a source, of CO<sub>2</sub> over this period. In many areas of the world, the opposite is true: In countries where large areas of forest land are cleared, often for agricultural purposes or for settlements, the LULUCF sector can be a net source of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

		<ul><li>More national-level information about land use, land-use change, and forestry is available from the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry chapter in the <em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</em></a>.</li>

		</ul><h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2014, the net CO<sub>2</sub> removed from the atmosphere from the LULUCF sector offset about 11 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Forests (including vegetation, soils, and harvested wood) accounted for approximately 87 percent of the total 2014 LULUCF CO<sub>2</sub> removals.</p>

		<p>The net carbon sequestration by the LULUCF sector has increased by about 5 percent since 1990, largely as a result of changes in the land area of forests and improved forest management.</p>

		<h2>Reducing Emissions and Enhancing Sinks from Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry</h2>

		<p>In the LULUCF sector, opportunities exist to reduce emissions and increase the potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere by enhancing sinks.

		<h3 id="dialog-title">6,870 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent – what does that mean?</h3>

		<h4>An Explanation of Units</h4>

		<p>A million metric tons is equal to about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!</p>

		<p>The U.S. Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is a little bit larger (about 10 percent) than a U.S. "short" ton.</p>

		<p>Greenhouse gas emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (<em>CO<sub>2</sub></em>) <em>equivalent</em>. To convert emissions of a gas into CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's <a href="/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">Global Warming Potential (GWP)</a>. The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO<sub>2</sub>, per unit mass.</p>

		<p>The GWP values appearing in the Emissions Web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">U.S. Inventory</a> and the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html">IPCC's discussion on GWPs</a>. <a class="exit-disclaimer" href="/home/exit-epa" title="EPA's External Link Disclaimer">Exit</a></p>
