What is Greenhouse Gas Data?
What is Greenhouse Gas Data?
What's new
On 21 October 2022, the secretariat updated the GHG data interface to include information from the latest 2022 GHG inventory data reported by Annex I Parties and the information provided in submissions of national communication from one Non-Annex I Parties (Chad) as of 27 September 2022.
_____________________________________________
On 8 November 2019, the secretariat completed the upgrade of the GHG data interface, thus fulfilling the mandate received at SBSTA 38.
The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to achieve "... stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."
Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective. This web page provides access to most recent data on national GHG emissions and removals as follows:
GHG Data - UNFCCC: this page is an entry to the UNFCCC GHG data interface which provides access to the most recent GHG data reported by countries that are Parties to the Climate Change Convention
KP Data - UNFCCC: this is a page with GHG data relating specifically to the Kyoto Protocol; the data are as reported by countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol
GHG Data - Non-UNFCCC: this page provides links to the web sites of various organizations that also collect, estimate and/or disseminate data on GHG emissions/removals
How to find the GHG data needed within the GHG data interface
The UNFCCC data interface provides a vast multitude of data. Data can be displayed for individual Parties or groups of Parties, for different greenhouse gases or for their sum, and in varying degrees of detail. To find the exact GHG data required, the user is advised to consult the following table where typical user requirements are mapped against the data availability on this site.
Latest UNFCCC publications with GHG data
The latest UNFCCC publications with GHG data under the Climate Change Convention are
for Annex I Parties: document FCCC/SBI/2022/15 (with GHG data for the period from 1990 to 2020);
for non-Annex I Parties: document FCCC/SBI/2005/18/Add.2
