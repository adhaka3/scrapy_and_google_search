The Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy database (upgrade of the former CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion) contains global annual GHG emissions from energy and related indicators, including CO2, CH4, N20 emissions from fuel combustion and fugitive emissions. This edition includes annual data for 203 countries and 42 regional aggregates, generally from 1960 (OECD) and from 1971 (Non-OECD).Emissions from fuel combustion were calculated using IEA energy balances and the default methods and emission factors given in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories. The fugitive emissions data are obtained from the IEA Methane Tracker 2022.With the objective to increase the scope of greenhouse gas emissions estimations, the IEA has covered in the 2021 edition the broad set of energy-related emissions, accounting for bulk of the category 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories. The additional coverage includes:-	Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion: estimates for CH4 and N2O have been added, following a methodology similar to that for the estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, and considering the type and level of disaggregation of activity data available at country level.-	Fugitive emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the coal, oil and gas energy sectors are now included for 91 countries and 18 regions. This includes category 1B of the 2006 IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories-	Aggregated figures for total energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are now included for 91 countries and 18 regions.Additionally, with the objective to increase the policy-relevance of the statistical information provided, the IEA has included in the 2021 edition time series of a set of CO2-related socio-economic indicators for a complementing set of over fifty countries in the CO2 emissions indicators data file of this database, to complement total emissions time series.Finally, following the upgrade in content, the IEA has also expanded the set of socio-economic indicators, adding new indicators based on total greenhouse gas emissions from energy.A free highlights version of the 2021 edition is also available. Data can also be visualized in our interactive Greenhouse gas emissions data explorer.Important note: the CO2 emission factors from electricity generation are no longer included in this data service. They are offered as a separate product, Emissions Factors.

This service is updated two times a year with a progressively broader geographical coverage. The April update includes all OECD countries, all IEA family countries (IEA members, Association and Accession countries), and any other country for which data up through year-2 have been received and validated. The final edition released in August includes complete time series of GHG emissions from energy by source and sector for all countries and regions up to the year-2, based on the latest IEA World Energy Balances.
