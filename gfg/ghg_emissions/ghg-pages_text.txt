The 2030 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act Plan
Main_ContentIn its progress report issued in September of 2022, MDE announced that Maryland achieved a 30% reduction in statewide GHG emissions (from 2006 levels) in 2020, which exceeded​ its GGRA target of a 25% reduction by that year. ​Maryland is roughly on track for meeting its 2030 GGRA Plan targets (with some room for improvement in ZEV adoption, clean energy generation, and building electrification) but meeting those targets would not achieve Maryland's new goal of reducing statewide GHG emissions 60% by 2031. MDE is required to produce a new GHG reduction draft plan for the state by June 2023 and a final plan by the end of 2023. ​​​​​ ​​​The 2030 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act Plan lays out our approach to Maryland's Greenhouse Gas reduction goals. The Plan calls for a goal of 50% reductions by 2030, as recommended by the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. With federal actions on climate change anticipated, Maryland expects to be able to achieve that goal.​  However, the goal has changed recently. The Climate Solutions Act of 2022 has updated the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act Plan.  "On or before JUNE 30, 2023, the Department of the Environment shall: (1) Submit a proposed plan that reduces statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 60% (from 2006 levels) by 2031 to the Governor and General Assembly; (2) Make the proposed plan available to the public; and (3) Convene a series of public workshops to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan. The Department shall, on or before December 31, 2023, adopt a final plan." ​
