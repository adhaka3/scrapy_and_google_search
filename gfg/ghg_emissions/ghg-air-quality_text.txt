Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Iowa Code section 455B.131, as amended by Senate File 485 in 2007, requires the Iowa DNR to include estimates of emissions of some greenhouse gases in its construction permitting and emissions inventory programs. This bill also instructs the DNR to create a voluntary greenhouse gas registry for purposes of tracking and crediting companies in Iowa that reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases or that provide increased energy efficiency.
Annual greenhouse gas inventories are required by Iowa Code 455B.104 which states that "by December 31, of each year, the department shall submit a report to the governor and the general assembly regarding the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the state during the previous calendar year and forecasting trends in such emissions...."  The most recent report focuses on calendar year 2021 GHG emissions.
The 2021 GHG Inventory is a "top-down" inventory based on statewide activity data from agriculture, fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, natural gas transmission and distribution, transportation, solid waste, and wastewater treatment. It also includes carbon sequestered or emitted from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). GHGs included in the inventory are carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFC), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
