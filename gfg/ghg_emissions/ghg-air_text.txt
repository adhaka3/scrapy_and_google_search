Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases (GHGs). These include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Solar radiation in the lower atmosphere acts like a “greenhouse” and prevents heat from escaping. Emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is the main cause of climate change.
Virginia is committed to addressing the pollutants that contribute to climate change. The Virginia Clean Economy Act establishes renewable portfolio and energy efficiency standards, and advances offshore wind and solar generation, and the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act addresses resiliency issues.
GHG Inventories
DEQ has conducted economy-wide GHG inventories for 2005, 2010 and 2018. The following reports and accompanying Excel files provide more information on these inventories. As required by § 45.2-1710 B. 9. of the Code of Virginia, GHG inventories for 2016 to 2019 are also included.
