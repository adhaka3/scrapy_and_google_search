Disaggregated Data Action Plan
In Budget 2021, funding was allocated to Statistics Canada to implement the Disaggregated Data Action Plan (DDAP). This funding will support more representative data collection methods, enhance statistics on diverse populations to allow for intersectional analyses, and support government and societal efforts to address known inequalities by bringing considerations of fairness and inclusion into decision-making.
The GDIS Hub serves as the primary platform for disseminating products and information related to Statistic Canada's Disaggregated Data Action Plan.
