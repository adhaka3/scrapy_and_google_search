Perspective
Dena & Jen:
'Enlightened companies go out of their way to invest and build a diverse pipeline of talent without compromising on fairness', believes technology professional Jen Mossop Scott. At a time when discussions around diversity and inclusion are gathering importance, Scott had a candid conversation with Infosys' Dena Tahmasebi where she shares her own experiences of curiosity- driven growth, the bi-directional nature of mentorship, and her thoughts on why young girls should look at a career in technology.
Dena & Egle
As the head of Global Infrastructure and Solutions at Roche, Egle Bronzini takes the work “ally” very seriously. For her, being an ally of diversity and inclusion, ignites a passion that inspires action. In a deep dive with Dena Tahmasebi of Infosys, Bronzini emphasizes that everyone can lead from their seat, and how it is important to be yourself, detach from the outcome, and look at ones career as a long-term process.

IWD 2021 Celebrations- #ChooseToChallenge
The theme for International Women's Day (IWD) 2021 is #ChoosetoChallenge. Choose to Challenge is envisaged as an inclusive campaign that calls attention to preferences, behavior and action that we demonstrate in the various situations and contexts that we navigate every day. It invites a deeper reflection into the 'whys' of action or inaction, as the case may be, and urges us to consider a different approach. An approach that will challenge the status quo 'positively' thereby facilitating an unravelling of intent, behavior and action in a way that will inform and guide our everyday as we navigate a larger 'purpose' with 'conscience

International Women’s Day 2022 Celebrations - #BreakTheBias
The theme for International Women's Day (IWD) 2022 is Break The Bias. Some of the most stubborn, most debilitating biases that persist, despite us fighting the good fight, often manifest in rather subtle forms. It’s easy to let them slip past us because they come to us camouflaged as friendly comments, ignorant questions or harmless explanations. Our campaign aims to compel everyone to spend 30 seconds taking note of these slips, that so many of us are guilty of, so we can grow to be more aware and of course less biased.
