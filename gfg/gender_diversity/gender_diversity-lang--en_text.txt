Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Branch (GEDI)
Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Branch (GEDI), part of the Conditions of Work and Equality Department of the International Labour Office, is responsible for promoting gender equality and inclusion, respect for diversity and managing the ILO’s programme on HIV and AIDS and the world of work.The Branch strives for the elimination of discrimination, including based on gender, race, ethnicity, indigenous status, disability and HIV status. It provides advice, tools guidance and technical assistance to constituents with respect to promoting more inclusive workplaces and addressing multiple grounds of discrimination. GEDI participates in United Nations inter-agency initiatives that promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, decent work for persons with disabilities and people living with HIV and the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples. The Branch also liaises with civil society groups and academic institutions. The different areas addressed by the Branch are central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to ensuring that “no one is left behind” in the implementation of this ambitious and transformative agenda.GEDI coordinates the ILO Action Plan for Gender Equality, which is the results-based tool for operationalizing the 1999 policy on gender equality and mainstreaming. The Branch oversees the ILO global Gender Network comprised of headquarters-based Gender Coordinators and field-based Senior Gender Specialists, along with gender focal points in all units and offices.
