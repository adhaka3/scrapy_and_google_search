Gender, Diversity and Justice: Overview and Recommendations

This paper offers analysis and recommendations for building a more inclusive justice system in the OSCE region, drawing on results of a needs assessment study carried out by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in 2017. The study, which relied on both desk-based research and the collection of field data, was structured around two separate but interlinked themes: a) gender and diversity among justice system actors, in terms of recruitment and selection of a diverse workforce and ensuring workplace equality; and b) the effects of gender and diversity among justice system actors on the fairness of outcomes, as perceived by end users of justice systems. This paper outlines specific challenges identified by the needs assessment study and highlights some of the good practice solutions used to address them.
