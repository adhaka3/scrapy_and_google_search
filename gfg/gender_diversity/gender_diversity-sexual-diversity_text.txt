Sexual & Gender Diversity
Alberta is a diverse community. Diversity can mean many things to each of us. It’s important that each definition reflect the ability to accept and celebrate each other. Diversity is all the ways we’re different from each other. It includes things like race, religion, culture, physical ability, mental ability, family make-up, socio-economic status and sexual and gender diversity.
When we talk about sexual and gender diversity, it’s important to understand these terms:
Sex: Categories (male, female) to which people are typically assigned at birth based on physical characteristics (e.g. genitals). Some people may be assigned intersex, when their reproductive, sexual or genetic biology doesn’t fit the traditional definitions of male or female.
Sexual Orientation: A person’s emotional and sexual attraction to others. It can change and may or may not be the same as a person’s sexual behaviour.
Gender/Gender Identity: A person’s internal sense of identity as female, male, both or neither, regardless of their sex.
Gender Expression: How a person expresses their gender. This can include how they look, the name they choose, the pronoun they use (e.g., he, she, zie, zim) and their social behaviour.

Each person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression are a part of who they are. When talking about these topics, it is common to see the acronym SOGIE, which stands for Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and (Gender) Expression.
The acronyms LGBTQ2S+, LGBTQ*, LGBTQ +, GLBT, LGBTTQ and LGBTQ2 refer to the spectrum of sexual and gender identities that are not cisgender and heterosexual. They include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, two‑spirit, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual. The asterisk (*) or plus sign (+) shows there are other identities included that aren’t in the acronym. These acronyms mean the same as ‘sexual and gender minorities’.
Historically, cisgender and heterosexual were the only identities considered ‘normal’ or valued in society. Many people use words that assumes everyone is heterosexual and cisgender (heteronormative language). An example of this would be using the terms boyfriend or girlfriend instead of partner, without realizing that it excludes sexual and gender minorities. You can’t assume someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity by looking at them.
It’s believed that as many as 1 in 10  Canadians identify as LGBTQ2S+. It’s important to read these numbers with caution since they categorize people without taking into account how complicated self-identify really is.
Sexuality is an essential and natural characteristic of all people that begins in early childhood. Many sexual and gender minority children and teens face challenges throughout their lives. Fear about how family and friends may react as well as fear of bullying, harassment, discrimination and prejudice may stop them from publicly identifying as a sexual or gender minority. Supportive families, schools and communities are important if LGBTQ2S+ children and teens are to do well in school and in life.
i –+Parent Tip+-
In November of 2015, the Alberta Education Minister directed every school board in Alberta to develop policies, regulations and procedures addressing the board’s responsibility to sexual and gender minorities.  Every student has a right to belong to a Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) or Queer-Straight Alliance (QSA)
Ongoing harassment and bullying can put children and teens at risk for dropping out of school, homelessness, depression and suicide. When the entire school community (students, staff and parents) is committed to making schools safe and inclusive spaces, LGBTQ2S+ students can feel safe and thrive at school.
i –+Parent Tip+-
All children have the right to feel safe and included in their community. If your child is the target of bullying they should:
tell someone they trust
keep a record of what’s going on (e.g., keep a record of each incident, keep examples of online bullying)
stay safe and not fight back
find support with the school or broader community (e.g., join a GSA/QSA)
know their rights as a member of the community (e.g., check out school anti-harassment policies and student code of conduct)

Transphobic Bullying
What Parents Can Do
Parents can be allies in making sure their LGBTQ2S+ child grows up healthy and strong. Parents can help their children learn to recognize stigma, discrimination and bullying. More important, they can help their children learn ways to cope. To learn more, see Bullying.
Tips for Parents:
Educate yourself. It’s important to educate yourself about sexual and gender diversity. There are some great online resources (see below) that you may find helpful. Remember that heterosexual and cisgender identities are often times thought of as ‘normal’ in our society. Think about what you can do to challenge this norm.
Be a role model and set a positive example for those around you. If you use anti-LGBTQ2S+ language and slurs, stop. Don’t laugh at jokes making fun of a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Use gender inclusive language and don’t assume someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
Be supportive and respond in a positive way. It takes a lot of courage for a child to come out. If your child comes out to you, it speaks to you as an approachable parent. Remember, it’s not a lifestyle choice. This means that counselling or trying to ‘change’ sexual orientation or identity will not work! Be respectful, open and non-judgmental. Keep your conversations private. If you make a mistake, say sorry and move forward. After all, we’re all human.
Take action. Identify and address inappropriate behaviour or actions targeted at your child that aren’t appropriate. Talk to your school if your child’s being bullied or harassed.
Get support. Find out what resources and support there is that may help your child. Offer to go with your child so they don’t feel alone.
Get involved. Advocate for the human and civil rights for everyone. LGBTQ2S+ rights affect us all. Stand by your LGBTQ2S+ child.
Be an ally. An ally is a person who promotes or supports the human, civil and sexual rights of sexual and gender minorities. All the points above are things you can do to be an ally for your LGBTQ2S+ child. Let your child tell you how you can be an ally for them. Remember, even the smallest actions can bring about changes.
Heterosexism, Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia in Schools
Gay-Straight/Queer-Straight Alliances (GSAs/QSAs)
Many sexual and gender minority children do well in their school environments and are proud of who they are. They are able to build positive and productive coping strategies, be role models and sources of support for other LGBTQ2S+ students.
GSAs/QSAs are student groups found in some K–12 schools. These groups create supportive and safe environments for sexual and gender minorities and their supporters. Schools that choose to start a GSA/QSA:
are looking for ways to create a safer school space
reduce bullying
support human rights and social justice related to sexual orientation and gender diversity
guarantee the right for students to start the group in their school, have regular meetings in a safe space, have an adult supervisor/sponsor and name the club
To read more, see Positive Impacts of GSAs/QSAs
If your child wants to start a GSA/QSA, they can take the following steps:
find a teacher or staff sponsor
meet with the school administration
find other students who may want to help start up the group
pick a meeting space
advertise the group
plan and hold a first meeting
set up ground rules/group agreements
plan for the future
For more information on GSAs/QSAs, see the Additional Resources page.
