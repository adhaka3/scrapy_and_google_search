Gender equality and diversity
Equal opportunities and treatment for all
The Turin Centre advocates for and aims to foster workplaces that are equal, inclusive, and respectful of difference. All workers should feel comfortable to be themselves at work.
Non-discrimination is a basic human right with social and economic consequences. Equality fosters opportunity, harnesses human talent, and boosts social cohesion.
The Centre’s training activities seek to eliminate discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, indigenous status, disability, and HIV/AIDS. They provide advice, tools, guidance, and technical assistance.
Gender equality is a cross-cutting policy driver for all ILO policy outcomes. The ILO implements and analyses interventions to ensure that women benefit equally from development efforts.
