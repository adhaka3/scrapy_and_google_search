SummaryWomen's representation in science and medicine has slowly increased over the past few decades. However, this rise in numbers of women, or gender diversity, has not been matched by a rise in gender inclusion. Despite increasing representation, women still encounter bias and discrimination when compared with men in these fields across a variety of outcomes, including treatment at school and work, hiring, compensation, evaluation, and promotion. Individual and systemic biases create unwelcome environments for women, particularly for those who additionally identify with other traditionally devalued groups (eg, women of colour). This Review draws on several decades of research in the field of management and its cognate disciplines to identify five myths that continue to perpetuate gender bias and five strategies for improving not only the number of women in medicine, but also their lived experiences, capacity to aspire, and opportunity to succeed. We argue for a move away from a singular focus on interventions aimed at targeting individual attitudes and behaviour to more comprehensive interventions that address structural and systemic changes.IntroductionThe year 2017 marked the first time in history when the number of women enrolling in US medical schools exceeded the number of men.1Association of American Medical CollegesMore women than men enrolled in U.S. medical schools in 2017.https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/applicant-enrollment-2017/Date: Dec 18, 2017Date accessed: September 14, 2018Google Scholar When this historic cohort of female medical students enters the workforce, what kind of work environment will they encounter?

Google Scholar In this Review, we offer insights from decades of research on diversity and inclusion in the fields of management and its cognate disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and economics, to propose suggestions for improving not only the number of women in medicine, but also their lived experiences, capacity to aspire, and opportunity to succeed. We acknowledge that most of this work has been done in Europe and North America and therefore might not be generalisable to all contexts. Moreover, any effective intervention would have to be tailored not only to country cultures and laws, but also to the specific organisations and departments in which these interventions are being made. Thus, the solutions proposed here should not be viewed as general fixed principles, but rather as a starting point for making more localised change. We start by debunking five myths that are commonly encountered when examining diversity and inclusion practices, and conclude by offering five research-supported solutions to bring about equity by design, an approach that we argue is particularly well suited to the medical field.Five myths about diversity and inclusionDiversity and inclusion policies and practice are becoming nearly ubiquitous in organisational settings. Finding an organisation or institution without a written statement outlining their commitment to diversity is now rare, and billions of dollars each year are used in the efforts to increase the representation of women and minorities.27Kaiser CR Major B Jurcevic I Dover TL Brady LM Shapiro JR Presumed fair: ironic effects of organizational diversity structures.J Pers Soc Psychol. 2013; 104: 504-519Crossref

Google Scholar To create lasting change and to prevent the current focus on diversity and inclusion from becoming another ineffectual trend in management, it is important to ensure that efforts are evidence-based and do not rely on common myths that might instead perpetuate the problems they are trying to solve. The five myths uncovered in this Review are not mutually exclusive—often being intertwined or potentially conflicting—but represent the most common (albeit inaccurate) assumptions people make about achieving diversity and inclusion.Myth 1: other people are biased, not meThe first myth that should be debunked is the idea that bias is a problem unique to only a few individuals: namely the racists, sexists, and bigots among us.29Chugh D The person you mean to be: confronting bias to build a better workplace and world.1st edn.

This research shows that intervening at the level of the individual is difficult, perhaps even impossible, and that attempts to alter the behaviour of individuals have not proven effective on their own. The introduction and application of stereotypes and other biases are most common under stress (eg, when time is restricted, when information processing demands are high, or when we are under pressure to perform). Accordingly, perhaps no better environment for unintentionally enabling bias exists than the medical workplace, where demands are high, resources can be low, and the pressure to perform the right action quickly can be overwhelming. Under these conditions, individual change must be embedded within a structure that is designed to enable progress. Management research about the medical profession has shown that practitioners can easily overlook or misinterpret cues in crisis situations, supporting the assertion that educating about and attempting to control bias are not enough.98Christianson MK More and less effective updating: the role of trajectory management in making sense again.Adm Sci Q. 2017;

Picador,
New York, NY2010Google Scholar Therefore, we argue that medicine is particularly well suited to interventions that target organisational change by designing for equality, and we outline five potential solutions in this context. These solutions are presented as a starting point for the innovation of refined and targeted solutions that consider departmental, organisational, regional, and national contextual needs and constraints. We should also recognise that we cannot achieve equality inside organisations without also achieving equality in people's lives outside of work. Structural inequalities in society should also change. The interventions that we will outline therefore focus on only one aspect of achieving workplace gender equality in medicine, but it is the aspect over which most people in the medical profession have more control.Solution 1: treat gender equality as an innovation challengeThe general approach to working toward gender equality, and diversity more broadly, has been largely rooted in attitudes and values. Justifications for gender equality are often discussed in terms of the so-called business case, focusing on how equity, diversity, and inclusion are economically productive, rather than focusing on them as the right thing to do.101Kaplan S Beyond the business case for social responsibility.Acad Manage Discov. 2019;
(published online Jan 3.)DOI:10.5465/amd.2018.0220Google Scholar Instead of initiating action toward finding a solution, such discussions on gender equality become stalled when trying to define the nature of the problem and in determining whether or not it is worthy of solving. Further, this type of framing can ultimately cause more harm than good.101Kaplan S Beyond the business case for social responsibility.Acad Manage Discov. 2019;
(published online Jan 3.)DOI:10.5465/amd.2018.0220Google Scholar To make progress in achieving gender equality, we must declare the discussion on whether and why we should pursue equality to be over. From this point, within contexts where this is possible (ie, within some contexts even the recognition of gender equality as a basic human right is still an ongoing challenge), we can switch our focus onto experimentation and innovation.102Kaplan S Because it's 2017: gender equality as an innovation challenge.http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Connect/Rotman-MAG/Back-Issues/2017/Back-Issues---2017/Fall2017-Inequality/Fall2017-FreeFeatureArticle-KaplanDate: 2017Date accessed: September 14, 2018Google Scholar As with any organisational initiative, gender equality should be approached with an open and scientific attitude, and the willingness to experiment and measure outcomes. Because the challenge of achieving equality is complex and multifaceted, openness to failure and the willingness to change tactics is a must, as is transparency via measurement and reporting, so that momentum and accountability for change remain high.The most promising solutions are probably behavioural and systemic changes that focus on creating a climate for change, an approach widely supported by the so-called nudge theory (with the idea of identifying easy to implement and economical ways to change people's behaviours by structuring their choices),103Thaler RH Sunstein CR Nudge: improving decisions about health, wealth, and happiness, revised and expanded edition.

Gender-inclusive workplace cultures are those that create a positive social climate for people of all gender identities, and can be cultivated through such practices as increasing the representation of women and gender non-binary people in leadership, by use of gender inclusive photos and pronouns in organisational communications, and adopting anonymous evaluation practices that minimise the potential for bias by eliminating gender cues such as names and pronouns.43Kalev A Dobbin F Kelly E Best practices or best guesses?

Google Scholar These kinds of systems are already very common in medical workplaces (eg, code systems clearly link specific situations to a prescribed set of responses). To advance toward the goal of gender equality, one suggestion is to put more emphasis on behavioural rather than attitudinal guidelines for promoting diversity and inclusion. For example, consider what might happen if a hospital decides to combat gender bias during the search for new attending physicians. A typical first step would be clearly outlining the goal (eg, to eliminate gender bias within search committees looking for attending physicians) and the rationale (eg, eliminating gender bias will benefit our team, patients, organisation, and other various stakeholders) This step is where most plans for improving diversity end. People are left with an abstract set of values and goals, but no distinct action plan for achieving them and no indication of how progress will be measured and success identified, which research over the decades has shown is an essential part of effective goal-setting.128Locke EA Latham GP Building a practically useful theory of goal setting and task motivation.

Google Scholar In the attending physician example, some of these guidelines might include ensuring that at least a third of hiring committee members are women, with success being identified as a steady state of 50:50 men and women on committees within 3 years; ensuring that only standardised questions and structured interviews are used, and using a statistically significant increase in the number of women hired over a 3 year period as an indicator of success. Without specific behavioural guidelines to inform practice, diversity and inclusion are often unable to advance beyond attitudes and goals. Examples of resources to equip managers with the tools to interrupt bias are the toolkits available via Bias Interrupters, an initiative of The Centre for Worklife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA, USA), and the Bias Busting Strategies worksheets created by the Engendering Success in STEM consortium.

We have made progress, albeit uneven across the world and specialties, in the number of women entering and working in medicine, but true progress on inclusion remains an elusive goal. By understanding more about how bias works and dismissing the myths that have held us back for so long, we can turn our attention and resources toward structural and systemic interventions that have more promise for success.For more on the #LancetWomen initiative see https://www.thelancet.com/lancet-womenContributorsSKan wrote the first draft.
