Gender Diversity in Investment Management
New Research for Practitioners

Gender Diversity in Investment Management
View the executive summary (PDF)
We sent the survey to our membership in May 2016 and received responses from over 5,000 CFA members (more than 4,000 men and more than 1,000 women). Adams, Barber, and Odean then analyzed the anonymized CFA Institute survey data and compared the survey results with several additional datasets to investigate the question of why women are underrepresented in this field.
