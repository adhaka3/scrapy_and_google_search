Gender equality and diversity at NTNU
The policy and action plan on gender equality and diversity at NTNU are closely linked with NTNU’s mission and vision of “Knowledge for a better world”. Knowledge for a better world is best created in an organization with equal opportunity, diversity and gender balance.
Promoting equality and tolerance regardless of philosophy of life, culture or gender is also a prerequisite for NTNU’s values – creative, critical, constructive and respectful. Consideration and respect must characterize interaction between staff and students.
