Gender And Diversity
BLOG: Let's talk about equality
The Gender and Diversity Division has the mission to promote gender equality, the development with identity of indigenous peoples, and the inclusion of people with disabilities, Afro-descendants, and the LGTBQ + population, while harnessing the talent and capacities that reside in these population groups to promote the socio-economic development of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Division fulfills its mission through direct and indirect investments, technical assistance, analytical work, and training.
We focus our work on three strategic lines of action:
Support the integration of proactive actions to address gender and diversity issues in lending operations across the Bank’s sectors
Develop new initiatives with innovative approaches for advancing gender equality and diversity
Generate data and evidence on what works to support future policies and operations
STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK OF OUR WORK
GENDER AND DIVERSITY SECTOR FRAMEWORK

The sector framework indicates the actions that, based on evidence, the IDB will carry out to address these challenges. Read the document here.
GENDER
AND DIVERSITY ACTION PLAN
Detailed guide to reinforce the implementation of the Operational Policy on Gender Equality, as well as providing support for gender and diversity mainstreaming throughout the Bank’s actions to expand and improve the quality of its interventions.
