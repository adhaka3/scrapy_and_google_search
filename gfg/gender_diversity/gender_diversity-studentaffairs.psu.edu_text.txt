Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity
The Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (CSGD) provides a comprehensive range of education, information, and advocacy services to students, faculty, staff, and alumni. We work to create and maintain an open, safer, and inclusive environment honoring gender and sexual diversity. Through educational, social, and supportive programming, along with workshops and individual consultation, the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity strives to serve the entire Penn State community. Our staff is eager to support you on your journey through Penn State! Please stop by the center to say hello, engage with us virtually, and get involved. This center will be enforcing University COVID guidelines including masks required, physical distancing, and sanitizing of all spaces.
